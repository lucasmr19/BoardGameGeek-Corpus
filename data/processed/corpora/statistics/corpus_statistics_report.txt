📝 Sample raw text:
['Very similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, you\'re trying to "outthink" your opponent(s), which results in an utterly boring tile-laying practice.', 'Smushed corner, splitting seams, components excellent.', "Eh, this one doesn't tickle me as much as other Knizias do, I think because it's like obnoxiously head-scratchy and chin-strokey or something.", "Samurai is a good game, but it's not a fun game. With both Babylonia and Caesar out now, I see no reason to go back to Samurai - although I might just for completion's sake at some point. I have only played at 2p and would like to try it at 3p. At 2p, I would rather play pretty much any no luck abstract over this as the randomness feels arbitrary and swingy. Overrated (at least at 2).", 'Rankings\n67th Best Game 2022\n60th Best Game 2023\n61st Best Game 2024'] ...
