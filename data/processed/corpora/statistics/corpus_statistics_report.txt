📝 Sample raw text:
['My rating is probably too low; I partly feel like I should hold off rating until I play another game of it. But this feels like a "like it, don\'t love it" situation. It is very Euro-y for sure. Very long, and a lot of balls to keep in the air. Closest comp for me would be Dominant Species, which is more complicated, but which I liked more; both have a very no-frills approach to visual design, which I\'m not crazy about. Die Macher is very, very fluid, almost abstract, more so than I expected. I would have liked to see a little more stability, a little more cross-over from one election to another. Given the time commitment and the need for at least 4 players, I can\'t see myself playing it very often; if I\'m going to play one game for 4 hours, it\'ll probably be Arkham Horror. But playing another game where I know what I\'m doing from the get-go would be helpful. Consider the rating provisional.', "There's a lot of cool elements to like in this game, but it also shows its heritage of one of the first proto-Euro style games.\n\nNamely, there is a lot of randomness going on still, in an otherwise strategic and lengthy game. Your goal is to gain votes, but getting votes has to do with aligning your party platform to a region, gaining popularity in that region, and getting members in that region. The issue is your party platform is partially determined by random card draws, so you can't match if you don't draw the right cards, and your popularity track is partially determined by random poll results that may be what you need or not.\n\nWhich means doing well and winning comes down a little to player decisions, and a lot to the luck of being able to position yourself in the right way. This may be (and is) an excellent commentary on politics, but it doesn't make for fun game mechanics.\n\nI've heard that various editions and house rules mitigate a lot of this as over the years the designer and others take ideas from more modern designs that have learned some things, and I think Die Macher likely would benefit from ways to further reduce and mitigate the randomness of these and other elements.\n\nIf those succeed, I think the rest of the game is pretty fun and the theme comes through pretty strong. The gameplay is interesting as everyone is rationing their resources in order to fight all these various elections and make sure you can afford the various things you need to.\n\nThe game I played though that's the final issue--because you get money also from winning seats, if you get poor early alignment on issues and poll results, you get far less cash too, and so it feels far too swingy to be a proper great strategy game, and why am I spending 3ish hours playing a game asking me to do all this resource management and planning if the main thing picking the winner isn't our decision making, but instead the luck of the draws?", 'This game is far too random for the amount of time and effort it takes to play it.', 'Thematic game - I enjoyed it\n/*#V4*//*stay*/', 'Who knew the german election process could make for an intriguing game? This is an amazing game considering when it was designed, but it does suffer a bit from design elements that show its age. Super crunchy and unforgiving!'] ...
