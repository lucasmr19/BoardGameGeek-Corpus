📝 Sample raw text:
['House rule: Loser has to buy a copy of Seven Card Samurai. There is no worse punishment than that.', 'Top 3 juegos de Knizia. Maravilloso juego', "I find it hard to explain why I don't like Samurai. It's well designed, but it just rubs me the wrong way I guess. It gives me a feeling of frustration: you can only react to one problem at a time, and when it's your turn again your opponents have created two new ones.\nNot being able to do everything is normal (and good) in a game, but here it just happens in a frustrating way.", "Good game, with great scoring. Just a little too chaotic for me. I think between expert players it often comes down to the order you draw your tiles.\n\n(I've played over 50 games online)", 'Rankings\n67th Best Game 2022\n60th Best Game 2023\n61st Best Game 2024'] ...
