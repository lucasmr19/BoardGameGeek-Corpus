Way too much reading and bookkeeping. The modifier cards are slow, so i would rather just roll some dice. Had about 20 hrs invested and had zero fun. Sold it and was glad to do so. Set up Mage Knight! It's superior in every way and the box is a hell of a lot smaller.",

The random short rest that you have to do all the time is horrible and the supposed-to-be puny skeletons heal themselves fast and have powerful shields while you have to burn cards every round and can't act at all.\nIf you like very restricted choices, diminishing returns and punishing yourself, then this game is for you!!\nOh, and when you finally got that combo together to deal slightly more damage than usual, then surprisingly a x0 modifier is drawn. RNG can be cool, but in \"Gloomhaven\" you don't have the room to compensate. \"Darkest Dungeon\" a video game that is notorious for its punishing RNG is way more doable and enjoyable than \"Gloomhaven\"!",

    "comment": "So it's a #1 disappointment. Really shocked how it takes #1 place here. One star for the amazing artworks. Souls-like-hard-level dungeon crawler, only for this genre fans.\n\nA campaign. Beautiful map stole my mind with it's beauty, area investigation and a legacy mechanic of using stickers, BUT.. The story behind is almost not exists. The story part is so small, the hero's motivation is so insignificant that you got almost nothing from RPG. For the story lovers the most pleasant moments will be a city and a road events. That's it. All other - is just a few lines of text and passing the really hard missions gives you nothing but a few points of xp, a few gold and a new location or two. No any feeling that you have some interesting story to involved in. The return on the invested time feels terribly low.\n\nThe game. Is really hard. I mean it. The monsters are powerful from the very beginning and the heroes are week and goes out of actions even if you use your cards wisely. The interesting mechanics of choosing the action form two cards and constantly loosing them feels frustrating. Like why the heroes are soooo weak? Ok it might be the 1st level issue, right?\nI checked my cards till the 9th level (not a spoiler) and.... It doesn't look much stronger in the end, while you have to gain 500 (500 Carl!) XP to get it, it won't help you much. Cause the monsters is progressing along with you and using the max monster's level it will be almost impossible to fight them. At least it will take a looooot of time to kill at least on of them.\n\nEven using the easy complexity level with 2 players it feels hard and painful. About an hour to set up all those things. A few hours per mission and... You got a few xp, a few golds to buy not too useful stuff on the city and almost no story in between to connect the locations in some meaningful story.\n\nKINDA SPOILER ALERT.\nWe were so disappointed that opened all boxes to look what's that treasures we were haunting for (opening it is one of the prize you get for accomplishing the heroe's mission). And you know what? The art is amazing and we expected some really powerful races to fight against the demons army and found... The same stuff you have initially. Just different beautiful art. To open it you have to pass at least 4-6 scenarios (if you're lucky enough) - it's about 12-18 hours of you life to have... The new hero with a slightly different actions but the same weak level. That's a real disappointment. Happily we decided not to spent our time for that anymore.\n\nIn a few words:\nArts: 10\nStory: 1 (almost does not exist)\nBattles in the dungeons: 2 (too hard on the easiest level, game is not giving any significant reward in return, feels painful and boring - too powerful monsters, too week heroes)\nPrice: 1 (really overpriced, no idea why)\nAmount of content: 5 (there's a lot of things which doesn't make too much sense)\n\nRecommended ONLY for the hard-code dangerous crawler fans without pretending to have any interesting story in between.

    "comment": "Extremely overrated.\nLet's start with the good things\n- The setting has some pretty interesting fluff. The various species in particular are unique and interesting. Some of the classes are also pretty original.\n-The art is marvellous.\n-The little secrets are interesting, it's a shame they ALL revolve around cryptology though.\n\nNow the strongest outliers for how bad the game is:\n-The tactics are extremely dull: the strongest plays are always to alpha strike as many enemies as you can before they counter.\n-The design space overall is narrow AND the game is too badly balanced to actually make good use of that narrow space: block and retaliate are bad choices 90% or more of the time.\n-It's stretching those few possibilities into so few classes that it doesn't become about depth of strategic choice but about bypassing constraints, such as that new bannerspear class that does the same thing pretty much everyone else does, but requires specific ally placements to do it. Plenty of skills are traps as well, most of upgrade choices for your skill deck are between a trap of a card (like double loss cards) and a good but boring one.\n-Neither the double card gimmick and the element gimmick bring intereting choices to the table. You end up playing the same cards together the whole time once you figure your good actions out, and anyone decent at tactics figures it out pretty much from the get go, which is inexcusable for a game with that lifespan, it makes the core gameplay loop extremely dull and repetitive.\n-For a game that prides itself on story, the character writing is nonexistent, there's more characterization in the retired events than everywhere else.\n-The claim about it being an \"ever-branching story\" are utterly false. If a sprout goes away from the trunk to come right back into it, it's not much of a branch; and the game only includes something like 4 of those fake branches in the whole core campaign? The rest is about which order you choose to do those in. If a video game RPG was called everbranching when whoever you side with in punctual events doesn't affect the ending, it would be a lie. The same applies here.\n-There some mechanics that both feel bad and whose thematic justifications are utterly insane, the best example being able to loot enemy corpses in plain sight in the middle of combat while your buddies are fighting for their lives, and when you end up with a comparatively insane amount of loot doing that over and over, you somehow can't share it, and you're supposed to believed that the other grizzled adventurers won't mug you for being selfish while they risked their lives.\n\nOverall, the whole thing is at once a shallow and extremely repetitive experience. The game benefitted from some expert marketing and a massive bandwagon effect, and its continued success is justified by a denial stemming from sunk cost fallacy, simple materialism and peer pressure. Surprisingly, Founders of Gloomhaven is actually a good game, and gets shafted because it disappoints the fools that may buy it trying to feed their gloomhaven addiction and end up with a game that actually requires analytic skill.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that there's no excuse for such a convoluted AI. Those can be justified if they provide to a game with great strategic depth, Gloomhaven is no such game.",

    "comment": "Gloomhaven is a relatively engaging and gamey implementation of a dungeon crawl that treads new ground rather than relying on familiar mechanics like 20 sided dice. The story creates a side veneer of interest that propels character advancement and investment in the proceedings but the whole thing would be overwrought and uninteresting without the core card play mechanic.\n\nSaid card system is both the strength and weakness of this game as a whole. It creates a puzzly situation each turn where you have to think through optimum play for both now and the future while also trying to take into account what the monsters are going to do (semi-random) and what your team is going to do (contextual on good communication and teamwork). The system does make for more interesting decisions than most dungeon crawlers, but the reliance that the system creates on effective teamwork is both good and bad in that it requires a fully invested, pretty cooperative team all on the ball to really hum as it is challenging enough to require that level of engagement, even with lower level monsters the inherent nature of the card play requires several steps of look ahead and makes this a fairly challenging game to play competently.\n\nI admire the design, as having this quantity of legacy material work, with the sheer number of player classes, all of the abilities, and so forth is quite an impressive feat. This base game is quite difficult to get into cold, as the game has no real introductory scenarios. For that, you need to check out the later Jaws of the Lion box which plays similarly but has a slimmed down campaign with less legacy but way better intro rules.\n\nAside: you want spin down monster token holders (for HP tracking). It speeds play a lot. Having initiative round tracking markers (which are included in Jaws of the Lion, but not here due to the number of monster classes) is also a big gameplay aid. Even with those, this thing is fiddly to set up and play in terms of the physical stuff you're dealing with and keeping track of.\n\nFinal assessment: I like the idea of this, but the implementation leaves me dissatisfied. All of the issues of slow combat in D&D are exacerbated here by the straight jacket that the card system puts on everything that you do in game. I find it odd that the most challenging thing in this game often ends up being just having the ability to move enough to effectively take your combat actions.\n\nWhile this gamey puzzle element is undoubtedly what the fans love about it, I find it obnoxious in practice; as so much of it is reliant on the team working together and a single action taken by one player can have negative cascading effects on the other players because of how actions are selected at the start of the round. Hence, optimal play would be the living hell of alpha player dictating actions to the team. Not having some table talk would make this impossible to be successful in though, so it ends up trying to split the baby with the suggestions in the rules (which effective amount to: table talk, but in general terms only) that try to obscure this core issue. I think I would have ultimately enjoyed this game a lot more if initiative was a separate roll or mechanic from the actions and players were allowed to just choose their actions when their turn comes up. Having movement not being tied to the cards would also likely have improved my enjoyment of it as well. The existing system is moderately more elegant, but it makes the play pretty dissatisfying to me and some of the players we may have otherwise enjoyed this game with.\n\nAt the end of the day, this takes the thing I dislike most about post 3.0 D&D (endless array of special powers you have to keep track of and combo with each other like a video game) and ports it into a puzzley board game that makes that the whole shebang. It's not a bad design per se, but it's not for me and I don't care to play it again. My ratings ultimately reflect how much I want or would be willing to play it, not its \"objective\" quality, hence the 2.",

    "comment": "I tried playing this 3 times. All 3 times with different player counts and different kinds of players just to make sure we are doing this right. I wanted to believe that it was us that were doing something wrong since this is no.1 on BGG but in the end we all just realized the same thing; Gloomhaven is a horrible game that is just praised by people who enjoy beating themselves up by losing over and over on the same scenario while spending hours doing the same thing.\n\nDespite how familiar I am with dungeon crawlers, tactical miniatures games and other games of much about the same style, Gloomhaven just felt like it was wrongly made as a board game instead of a video game.\n\nThen I tried the video game and it felt just as boring and tiring. I do believe there is something for some players who really want a very extreme and grindy experience with intense combat puzzles but generally, as a board game, I would hardly recommend it to anyone really. There are much better games out there that do combat much faster and with less handling of the AI and are simply more fun than Gloomhaven.\n\nThe \"narrative\" as they call it in the game is fun but barely ever there. It's more like a plastered novel that just compliments the 10 minutes you spend outside of the dungeon (which is where you spend most of your time while playing the game anyway). That is all ok, but I find it ridiculous and even misleading considering how much a lot of places and people advertise this game as a legacy game that is heavy on the narrative side.\n\nA huge disappointment really and I say that as someone who really tried to love it for what it is.\n\nOnly reason it gets a 3 is because the combat mechanics with the cards are brilliant. Still extremely slow though and you barely get the chance to shine all that much when you are too busy getting tired from the same problems the game has overall.",

    "comment": "Thematic games and RPGs are not my cup of tea so I'm not the target audience. However, the campaign experience of playing with the same group of buddies is epic, the progression of seeing your characters level up and getting better is the major appeal I think. Overall the game itself is clever and well designed. If you like dungeon crawlers and heavy theme and story telling in games (which I don't) then this is probably as good as it gets. The card play in the dungeon components could probably be spun off into a mediocre arena death-match style of game in its own right.\n\nHowever the pace of play is too slow and has far too much randomness for my liking. For example, some little cheesy bad guy poisons you, muddles you, and immobilizes you two turns in a row because this class of bad guy somehow got initiative less than 10 on consecutive turns and you lose the scenario because of it, or you have a 1/20 chance of missing your attack but somehow get those odds six times in a row and get exhausted causing your buddies who are doing well and enjoying themselves to have to restart the scenario and lose their gains. These things actually happened to me in a recent play -- that type of thing is just painful and frustrating and definitely not enjoyable for me, conversely lots of people view this type of stuff as exciting apparently. It is a huge chore and pain to set up, put back, and store. I would equate this game to a well designed Java program that is just oozing with complicated OOP design patterns: it works, the majority of people rave about it, but definitely isn't my thing.",

    "comment": "It is funny that I read a lot of people saying \"the battles and card management feels like a puzzle\". That's because that's all it is. Decision making is not cost-benefit but rather min-max with rng thrown in.\n\nOther than the combat system, the story is bland and traditional in all sense of the term \"fantasy adventure\". The \"event\" cards are paper thin attempts at breathing life into a corpse of a world. The characters are pretty poorly balanced. The systems are underbaked and extremely linear at best, anti-thematic at worst.\n\nThe most egregious flaw (and the one that made sure I won't buy any of the designers products) is the \"X\" envelope. In order for players to find it, they have to dump dozens of hours of their life looking for clues that are...\nA) entirely skipped if they do not follow specific story lines that they would have no way of knowing if they are on the right path\nB) impossible to complete without leaving the game consulting online resources to plug the developer's website/email list\nThis alone would not be rage inducing but there is never any feedback on whether the player is on the right track *and* the original solution contained a typo that was then reprinted in later editions. So players could have spent so much of their life on this one element of a game that they loved, only for it to wholly and utterly disrespect their time\n\nAdd in the toxic community that the creator cultivated and that will round out my 2 out of 10.",

What represents itself as the grandest dungeon crawler of all time with a lush story filled with choices is really just the same hand management efficiency puzzle over and over again complicated by a massive setup, teardown and admin ask from the user. Despite the lifetime of content and the supposed weight on BGG, it offers a very thin experience in terms of player choice. In my experience the dunegon is a puzzle that doesn't really have very many options for how to solve it due tot he exhaust mechanic where you must complete the dungeon before you run out of cards. This turns every scenario into a math problem where you must pre-calculate every move you plan on taking for the rest of the game, lest you find yourself thinking you're crushing the enemy only to find out hours and hours later that you don't have enough cards left to win. Complicating matters are the imperfect information you have as the player by way of unopened rooms and the modifier deck which serve to throw even the most accurately calculated plan out the window. It's just terrible game design, that masks itself in a robust amount of content.\n\nIf BGG tracked the plays of the folks that praise this game to the ends of the earth, I would estimate that the average amount of plays is less than 10 out of the over 100 scenarios in the game.",

You would think that a system opaque enough to spawn a challenging fan-made online quiz would produce less robotic and less exploitable enemy behavior during combat. It's almost like the role of Dungeon Master or a robust digital AI system is necessary for meaningful enemy tactics in games like this...\n\nThe combat modifier deck feels like a downgrade to custom dice or a bag of tiles (ala Arkham Horror LCG) for seemingly no other reason than to give players the illusion of less randomness, but with the added headache of constant reshuffling.\n\nThe exhaustion/recovery system is needlessly frustrating and weirdly unthematic, and it is the only real source of difficulty in the whole game. Hoarding cards during the early portions of a scenario is crucial to ensure your character doesn’t become prematurely exhausted, but this means that most scenarios consist of hours and hours of piddling around with Move 2 / Attack 2 effects until you get to the last room and can actually start have fun playing the cards that make your class compelling. Gloomhaven makes no effort to emphasize the importance of this scenario cadence in the rules, and learning it yourself through several three hour delayed player eliminations early on is a vicious, depressing waste of time.\n\nThe plot is paper thin and the writing is shockingly cliché for how original the world seemed from the outside. The campaign is also pretty unresponsive to scenarios being done out of the \"intended\" order; random characters that the party hasn't met yet will pop in and out of story segments, only to later be \"introduced\" to the party after circling back to their branching scenario path. I get that this stuff is harder to get right in a physical medium (a recurring theme for Gloomhaven), but it shouldn't be this blatant.\n\nThe treasure looting system also breeds an unhealthy amount of tacit hostility with your \"teammates\"; treasure is individually gained and cannot be shared, and for some reason that has never made any thematic sense the mercenaries cannot pick up any coins or open any chests on their way out of a now-empty dungeon at the end of a scenario. The system incentivizes tactical greed, but all it takes is one overly-greedy move by a player to cost the whole group a scenario that may have already eaten up hours of playtime, and the only solution offered by the game would be to restart and try again from the beginning. Gross. For this reason I am convinced that Gloomhaven, like so many other coops, only really works as a solo game.\n\nConsidering that, why am I paying over a hundred dollars for a solo dungeon crawler that pales in comparison to even the most middling video games in this genre?",

I would take either of those games one thousand times before I'd allow myself to be forced into another game of Gloomhaven, ever.\n\nAbout to discard/recycle our game - what a waste of $120.\n\nMar 2021\nWell, my son really wanted to stick with this game, so I did (aren't I a good dad?  ). After the first several plays where we spent about 3 minutes looking for rules in the rulebook for each minute spent actually playing, things have evened out *a bit*. We still spend far too much time for my taste looking for things in the badly-organized rulebook, and setting up scenarios with functionally-equivalent but slightly-different-artwork pieces, but we have at least hit on a way to make the scenarios themselves enjoyable: we try each scenario for the first time on the \"correct\" difficulty for our level, and if we lose (and it wasn't close) we bump down a level and almost always beat it on that next try. This keeps things moving.\n\nI still think this is the worst-organized rulebook I've ever seen. It's really, really bad. Almost like they tried on purpose. When you can find something, it is typically fairly clear; it's the organization that's just mind-bogglingly bad. Which makes it really, REALLY hard to start playing.\n\nDec 2020\nI wanted really badly to like this game. Played the first scenario, and it was almost the least fun I've ever had playing a game. Starting with a rulebook that is so poorly laid out, it makes Fantasy Flight Games look like a model of precision and exactitude. There are a billion little niggly rules that are impossible to find. There are TONS of overlay tiles that all do the exact same thing, and make setup an absolute chore.\n\nAnd the first scenario is so hard, it's essentially a giant kick in the teeth from the moment you start playing for the first time. As the person who had read the rules and was teaching the game to three other people, it was a never-ending constant repetition of vague ideosyncratic minutae for literally over an hour.\n\nThe choices during the scenarios are basically how to best chain your actions together to force the dumb enemies to impale themselves on you and carefully plot your and their movements to minimize the massive amounts of damage they can do to your characters.\n\nIt was awful and I'm never playing it again.",

A nightmare to set up and take down unless you use organizers. VERY Clunky combat (like a legendary amount of it). Bland art and story. Most people give up within the first game because its too difficult to engage in. For those who can understand, good luck keeping them around regularly to finish the content...this thing requires a part times job worth of dedication. Playing it even feels like a part time job except I am not getting paid a dime.\n\nThe concept of having to chose two cards and use each half of a card is just not very fun to me. Even less fun is spending possibly hours on a single run just to exhaust through your deck and be forced to leave the dungeon. There are some mechanics that come in later that are legacy based (I dont want to spoil anything) that can be pretty cool, while others I just straight detest with a passion. My personal favorite thing about the game are the characters. While the main archetypes found in RPG's are all there, this game has a pretty interesting take on all of them and even some more original ideas. The game also includes pretty good quality pieces, cards, tiles, etc. (An absolute f*ck ton to be accurate).\n\nIts like the game was created by artificial intelligence that understands only logic, but not emotion. There are some things about this game that are awesome... but they are ultimately just let down by weird rules. I would have much rather just rolled dice and had a deck of cards that didn't exhaust or something less cumbersome and just...unfun. Shit...I would have preferred even those terrible spinners to the just each half of a card and exhaust the deck mechanics. The combat is just genuinely not very approachable for a lot of people. Also not too much of a fan of how elements wane and wax strength; its a great idea but its just fiddly to me and could have been done in a different way. I haven't done summoning yet, but I hear its a dumpster fire.\n\nIf you are into tactic based games that are pretty challenging where you can waste an entire night getting nothing done or any rewards this is for you. Im not really into that sort of thing period; while I do love a challenge im just not too into the XCOM or Dark Souls level of challenge and maybe wasting my time and ruining my entire run. Literally every time I try to pull this thing out and play it I am immediately reminded of how not fun it is and just put everything back and shelf it.",

The story is pretty bad. \"You sit at the local in when some rich person with a special appearance approach you and ask if you can kill a bad guy for some gold\". The events that could be the \"role-playing\"-part are embarrassingly bad. Compared with for instance the Lone Wolf series, this is kindergarten-level. Many times you will be forced to choose from two stupid alternatives, and you get the feeling that the outcome from the choices is random. Some rules are strange. For instance, you have to loot all treasures in a scenario before you kill all monsters because the scenario ends when the last monster is killed. Just like that. You do not have time to open the chest beside you, but you can walk all the way back from the dungeon. The characters are not allowed to exchange items or gold. It just feels strange. You can make house rules to fix some of this, but that would mess up the balance in the game. This is a computer-game made into a board game. Sure, there are some fun parts and you can do some cool combinations with the different characters' powers, but the play-time is veeery long relative to the fun you get from it. If you have 12-year-old kids with lots of imagination, maybe it could be worth a try. I would rather play sudoku.",

Not neccessarly a bad thing but with this game it's no fun at all. Also so many small deviating rules.\nThe card combat mechanic might be unique, but you have to be lucky to draw the right card (attack modifier) at the right time. Otherwise... You can loose everything and \"Go back to start and don't collect anything\". Sounds familiar?\nEverything is highly calculated with no space for creativity or story telling (exploring - collecting). Felt like I needed to follow a script instead of taking an adventure.\nI cannot believe that people are devoting hundreds of hours to this game and keep raving about Gloomhaven, Jaws of the Lion and Frosthaven.",

    "comment": "Popular doesn’t mean good.\n\nI come from a background of computer RPG games of the likes of Baldur's Gate and I can see how someone not familiar with those games, can find this game thrilling but if you like the idea of turn based combat, leveling up your character and progressing in a story, a boardgame is just not the ideal medium to do that, or at the very least, Gloomhaven is certainly not the ideal way to do that. RPG video games just do that so much better.\n\nOnce we get past the mountains of bookkeeping and maintenance around Gloomhaven, all that is left is a repetitive and unbalanced card management game. The core of the gameplay is simply looking through your deck of abilities and execute rules mindlessly. You can't be too strategic and plan ahead and you also can't take risks because the attack modifier is just too unpredictable for you to create any meaningful and reliable strategy.\n\nHaving to look through your deck is frustrating, having to operate the enemies is annoying, having to keep track of the damages and debuffs is excruciatingly annoying and finicky. Having to populate rooms once you walk into them midway through the game is anti-climatic and also annoying. Between all the ability decks and attack modifier decks you might end up with literally 15 different decks laying around on the table, are you kidding me?\n\nThe ability deck mechanic in this game is completely flawed and just creates a false sense of strategy and options when in the majority of cases, you are always shoved into a corner with one, maybe two actually correct plays to make. I can come up with multiple better ideas in how to force a rotation among abilities better than simply having you lose the card for the scenario simply because it was a good ability. What happened to the dude in a thematic sense? did he forget how to cast a spell? It's a ridiculous mechanic. Perhaps an ability point system could have been used, with better cards costing more AP and not as powerful cards costing less AP. The same exact end result would have been achieved without the demented discard and lost piles. The concept of mana or energy could have also been utilized instead, with powerful cards costing more mana, which then could have been recovered through resting. Again, same end result without cumbersome and constant deck fiddling.\n\nThe setup, storing and overhead management of this game is ridiculous (to note that I even bought the Broken Token insert!). All the different decks that need to be managed and stored, with certain attack modifiers being added only in certain scenarios which then need to be removed. Ability decks that get changed and updated. Everything is so cumbersome and it adds nothing to the gameplay itself.\n\nUltimately, despite my best efforts, I struggle to find a single thing about this game that is fun or well designed. Even the components and artwork is uninspired and mediocre at best. I can also understand why to so many, this seems like a fantastic game. It's the perfect game for gamers who like to be guided into a decision rather than having multiple real options. It's easy, it's comforting and offers that sense of reward and gratification common to role playing games which again, if that's what you crave, try playing some PC RPG games, they scratch that very same itch, times 10. Or, if you are looking for a great co-op boardgame, with meaningful decision-making and a legacy component that actually changes and evolves the gameplay itself, then try Pandemic Legacy.",

I know most don’t agree with that, but being combat is the majority of this game I realized very quickly it wasn’t for me.

You need to modify rules for yourself to get logical movement.\nIncomplete ruleset. I was called a troll numerous times even though i was trying to point out inconsistency of rulebook with quiz and FAQs(that they supply in forum but i have never had to refer to, nor should i, the complete set of rules should come with game that you buy, nowhere does it say it does not). Rules in rulebook are the axioms to derive how to play.Downgraded to a 2, was a fan for awhile until i met something quite dangerous online. Be very careful.\n\nAt 23 scenarios in, dropped rating to a 2, never to play again, it is pointless waste of time.\nThe main reason for the drop, is the monster ai is too hard to determine based on rules. They obfuscate meanings of conditions within multilayered rules and in unexpected sections. See the poor results on monster ai. You need to be the designer to understand the rules and the officials on bgg forum did not open up to any feedback that was negative. It was not a fun community for me to enter into, i came out broken.\nIt is a labourious game, with many scenarios that with 2 to 3 players will take a couple hours from set up to dismantle at least. Some went much longer because of the thinking and actions required. The story is bland but supposed to get better?\n\nThe individual scenarios were good challenges, but at the end had to ask, is the time worth it? Being a blend of strategy and luck you cannot be sure which made you successful or fail?\nIts more a kinda of clever play with statistics, that if you play as best you can you will finally succeed. However each time you try it is a massive amount of time invested. If you fail the same scenario many times, it just feels like a waste. Do you even have the best charecter set? I would guess alot of scenarios i passed were through my mistakes. People claim big things online, they must be so good. Didnt get up to high level characters with heaps of items so maybe it does become no challenge but whats the good of that? Also where did they get all that gold, cheat picking it up at end?\nMostly down to statistics, whether it is with cards or dice, i dont care, but i find nothing wrong with those wonderful d&d multi faced dice. This is same but cards.\n\nWay too complicated with unessessary obfuscation that results in inconsistent outcomes.\n\nIf you can answer this on your own, kudos to you. You probably like 'PURE' mathematics, logic and reasoning.\n\nThe monster ai movement!\nIf am 'muddled' and it is impossible to remove it.\nAnd muddle causes disadvantage.\nAsked the question:\nHow should i move to remove disadvantage?\nWhich answer is best?\n\nA. B and C, you cannot remove muddle therefore cannot remove disadvantage.\n\nB. Dont move,you cannot remove muddle therefore cannot remove disadvantage.\n\nC. Move anywhere,you cannot remove muddle therefore cannot remove disadvantage.\n\nMy answer is A and i am told i am wrong? Do you know why?\n\nI suggest dont consider muddle for movement, move as normal, makes it easier and consistent for players, increasing strategy and for no real impact to game otherwise. I would play this way(the rulebook says muddle is a -ve condition to attack). Still wouldnt waste my time, more fun games out there.\n\nIf muddle is intended to impact movement it would be simpler just to explain that in muddle description, not sure why rules have been hidden like that, trips up players when they have so much to remember for a round.\n\n\n\nOh and the cardboard is cheap, unlikely to make through your campaign. The figures are cheap more 2d than 3d. The monsters are cardboard that damages trying to stand them up. In the end could not overlook these deficienies when other games are much greater quality for less$.\nYou progress through the game by placing stickers on what looks like an incomplete map. Really! Thats all you accomplish. Can be done in minutes if you like, no need to waste hours of your life. Get your 5 year old to do it.\n\nVery niched, cannot share with casual gamers, wife hated it.\nI have alot more time to pursue worthwhile activities now i have seen it for what it is.",

(The difficulty of the first mission was perfect, though: we played on \"normal\" or whatever, 4-player, and won with one player down in a heroic sacrifice & two others one turn from croaking. If we hadn't had the experienced player pushing us on--\"there are only a couple guys left in here, so we should probably kick open the next door\"--we wouldn't have made it.)\n\nMy complaint is that the fundamental mechanic of the game--choose two cards, use the top of one & the bottom of the other, discard until you rest--is bogo-thematic. (As is the \"standing-there-doing-nothing causes you to get fatigued enough to become a casualty just as fast as sprinting-around-getting-in-melee\" mission clock.) (So is the Loot action, and loot in general.) And, coming from playing a lot of Dungeon Degenerates, \"I will hit Generic Mook #9 for 3\" was a lot less fun than \"I will be in guard stance and hit the Sex Dwarf with my bastard sword,\" and the way the generic mooks' hit points get tracked seemed pretty clunky, too; \"how many hit points does this guy have left\" was like a 4-step process.\n\n* That said, I can't see why it dominated the Golden Geeks, other than that it was A) an expensive Kickstarter game with B) miniatures and C) consumable elements. The character & dungeon map art is fine--nothing special--but the main environment map art is real bad.",

Typically, we'll play for three or four hours, accounting for setup and teardown as well. I find that I end up making only a handful of meaningful decisions over that time period and the rest is spent just going through the motions. It's just a terrible ratio of active gaming to time invested.\n\nI like deep games that maximize interesting decisions and player interaction while minimizing downtime and setup/teardown. Gloomhaven is my personal hell.\n\nEdit: lots of private messages from Gloomhaven fans made me reconsider my rating.

Leaving aside the weird, NPC-type character races (your choices are quite limited up front) and the badly-organized box (its half-assed attempt to provide some sort of organizational structure for the myriad decks of cards is insulting), my problem with this game comes down to the opening scenario. To say it is brutally difficult is an understatement. It is downright impossible. Changing strategies, characters, skill/spell loadouts, all yielded fast, frustrating death, if not in the first room, soon upon entering the second room of three. Forget trying to meet the (randomly-generated and very, VERY odd character goals) for the scenario. You'll need to seriously ratchet down the difficulty, beyond what the game even allows, basically house-ruling a way to win the first scenario. IE, the only way to win that first scenario is to cheat. What a fun way to play a game.\nAfter running into loss after loss on the first scenario, I boxed this game up, sold it, shipped it, and never looked back.\nThere is no reason for a game to punish players who have just started. It's bad game design. A well-designed game can teach as it goes, introducing players to the complexities of gameplay as it progresses. A dedicated gaming group will not tolerate a game that dishes out constant losses, no matter how good it might get later on. There will be the inevitable responses of \"get gud,\" etc, but a game has to have a hook to draw gamers in. This has only disappointment and frustration at the outset. Gloomhaven is not a well-designed game, no matter what may come later on.",

It's probably the most ambitious dungeon crawl adventure game I've ever played... and I'm not saying that as an accomplishment.\n\nGloomhaven is like combining D&D with filling out your income tax returns, except you have to use cardboard disks to do all your calculating instead of a calculator. This game combines elements from different genres into a Frankenstein's Monster of dungeon crawl action. I've never been more bored playing a game than during our introduction to Gloomhaven.\n\nThe only fun we had during the intro scenario were the few moments of levity we extracted out of the shared misery of painstakingly referencing and re-referencing the rules for the overly complicated combat mechanics over the course of two masochistic hours. We spent more time saying \"what the hell does this card do?\" and trying to keep track of who had what initiative than we did resolving anything that actually progressed the game to a conclusion.\n\nThis is the Star Wars prequels of adventure games. You're force-fed a vision of what an adventure is supposed to be like with none of the fun of an adventure. Your decision tree revolves around poorly designed cards that often resulted in our players just moving two spaces and punching a guy because that was often better than the abilities printed on the card... or maybe they didn't, I really don't know what the rest of my group was doing most of the time because I was so bored after spending an hour killing six Bandits that I checked out. I honestly don't know how this dumpster fire of a game got published and I sure can't fathom how it climbed so high on this website.\n\nThis is what happens when a game doesn't go through a traditional design process; conceptually this game is fantastic, in practice it's every idea one man ever had thrown into a single box and fused into something resembling a game. \"No\" is not a dirty word and this game would have been a lot better if someone had learned to say it at any point in the design process.\n\nAs a game store retailer, I feel obligated to call all of the customers I sold this game to and apologize for taking their money.",

The core mechanic of choosing two cards is nice and the timer of the cards on your hand is fine, but seriously I expected so much more.\n\nMy main problem is that within one game I as a character don't get stronger but weaker and the game takes sooo much time and maintance and it's usually just going through the motions. I really think that computer games like: Darkest Dungeon, Cardhunter and Desktop Dungeon are much nicer to play. This box is so full of stuff and it's nice, but the setup is such a pain for so little reward. After playing one character I would immediately want to switch for the next game so developing them between games is not that engaging.\n\nThe best game to compare it to that works for me (and GH doesn't) is Spirit Island. There I am actually progressing through the game, getting better, there is a sense of going for late/early game strats. It's also more interesting, because it's not another hit monsters as hard as you can as quickly as you can. There is more room for creative cooperation.\n\nGloomhaven is fine for its genre, but it's not game changing. I was expecting more, I could play it from time to time if the setup, play and teardown weren't so painful.\n\nI've played the PC version and it's not much better unfortunately.

    "comment": "Gloomhaven has some great card strategy and deck building elements, but it is initially very slow and suffers from repetitiveness. I initially did not like my first few games due to overly simple plots, set up time, and limited variety in play. The story and strategy grew on me, but over time I would call this game samey in a way that many will hate. There's also very little story for a legacy game. You basically just fight over and over, which is really puzzle solving. There are a plethora of scenarios to play, but they are predictably samey. Get in quick, kill, and repeat.\n\nSetup and teardown are extremely long. An organizer for setup and tear down is a good investment, else you'll have to dedicate the table for a while. You can only slightly deck-build compared to LCGs, but there's decent variety between the characters. There are enemy AIs, but again, many feel samey. The narrative is less hit than miss, which is unfortunate, but an imaginative group can add a lot with a little role-play.\n\nThe worst part of the game is the grind; unlocking cards, new characters, and equipment is very slow compared to many games. Slowly the prosperity allows new characters to start at higher levels, but even that is too slow. I don't see how people don't complain more about this! I house rule that you gain one level per game and double the income, and it still feels slow.\n\nThe brilliant part of this game is the ability to control the balance of the game no matter the number of or level of players; so you can easily get this to the table more than most campaign games. Similar to Mage Knight, there are times where players may have dozens of choices and slow the course of play, so best player count varies.\n\nI don't really care for the art, the lack of art on the cards, or the programming that can waste cards just because someone else takes your action first. I'm also getting annoyed with rushing through every quest just to fit the way the card management works. It didn't bother me at first, but when you realize that you're going to repeat a dungeon, and you still have to finish out the play for the experience points, it becomes tedious to me. I'm glad this game exists, but surprised at the ratings, because this is a grind!\n\nDingo",

    "comment": "So as my rating would suggest, I am not on the Gloomhaven bandwagon. I cannot fault the ambitious scope of the game (if you love it, this game is fantastic value for money) but I find little in the gameplay that I enjoy. This is almost certainly connected to my own biases, as I can recognise there is certainly a good game inside Gloomhaven's giant box, but it's not the game for me.\n\nGloomhaven feels mechanically disconnected from its theme. I certainly wouldn't consider it the highly 'thematic' game (it's high 'thematic rank' on BGG annoys me more than anything else about the game). What is meant to be dynamic fantasy combat maybe a few minutes in length is simulated by slow, considered card play that takes place over hours. My decisions felt more strategic than the cut and thrust of skirmish combat. Tactical decisions on which card to play need to account for longer-term strategic goals, as powerful cards are often lost from the deck once played. This makes the game ponderous, as each player decides how to best solve the puzzle in front of them using the resources they have available. I enjoy both tactical and strategic thinking in games (see my highly rated games), but prefer that be married to themes that feel strategic (wargames representative of multi-year conflicts for example).\n\nWhere my biases are specifically relevant to my feelings on Gloomhaven are that I love tabletop roleplaying games. So much so that I was involved in running RPG conventions, have played over a hundred different systems across multiple genres and enjoy reading the rules and splat/world books in my spare time. But....there is one aspect of roleplaying I have never enjoyed. I dislike the classic Dungeons and Dragons dungeon crawl (DC). A DC, in my experience, is more about solving a puzzle and displaying rules knowledge than getting into character and generating a collective narrative. In fact, I've often said..'if you want to play a DC, why not just play a boardgame?' I guess I've now played that board game and realised I don't really like that either. The boxed text for Gloomhaven reminds me of all the parts I hate about DnD pre-written modules, with their 'on rails' plotlines and almost irrelevant backstory (who cares about the villain's goals...we're just going to kill them regardless).\n\nThe caveat to all of this is that I have only played a small number of missions. But I saw nothing in those missions that makes me want to ever play the game again. I'd much rather play a simpler dungeon-crawler, where the gameplay may have less depth, but where the game feels more dynamic and fast-paced. Clearing one room should not take 2-3 hours!",

It may be that dungeon crawlers in general just don't do it for me. It took me a few plays of this to understand that I simply hate the hand management / card mechanism. It continues choices in a way that force players to make arbitrary moves that make no sense in the world of the game. I see this as a new problem -- I want ultimate freedom to choose moves that make sense in the moment.\n\nPersonally, I like playing with lots of fiddley bits in games. I enjoy setting this up. The best part of the whole experience was punching out the hundreds of pieces.\n\nFor three players, it takes us a ridiculously long time to do a playthrough. I guess we think too much, for me it's again a problem if hand management.\n\nWe have all the cutouts and standees in matchbox car boxes. Even so the remainder of the board and character pieces don't fit sensibly in the box. Really annoying.\n\nOn the positive side: I appreciate the storytelling and the complexity.

Looking for next level I found Gloomhaven and based on the rating I was couriers to play that game. When I open the game I found lots of stuff and the fighting mechanism based on the card was very cool. So my first impression on this game was wow. However, when I first played the game my interest in this game fall very quickly. Why? Because like in most scenarios in Heroquest you do always the same. Kill, kill, kill. Did I mention Kill?\nIn summary, i kept my old good Heroquest and sell Gloomhave. I can understand that many people like this game, but this was not mine.",

If I get an artifact in one mission, I would like to use it the next time. When I make a decision in one mission, I would like consistency to be in the next. There is no story here, the threads do not connect with each other. It's just a knuckle. The first 10 scenarios are still ok before you know that all this is not sticking together and combat mechanics pleases you. Later, the game gets tired in every respect. There are a number of not well thought out rules to remember. Develop parts of the character is poor, there are no interesting weapons for them. After reaching the last level, the character does not make sense to play it, because it makes no sense to collect any things, she will no longer develop. The retirement system is not working well either. I do not like that this is a cooperative game, and yet each player plays for himself, compete for resources with allies.\nThe amount of goodness in this game compared to the price is great. But what if handling it is terrible, preparing scenarios is time-consuming, taking everything out, hiding it, setting it up, finding individual elements, etc. Every time I look at it and wonder if I would like to take it out and play, the answer is no. In total, we only took this game apart once, we played it for a few weeks/months, and when we put it away, no one wanted to take it out and let it sit again for another x amount of time.\n\nDungeon Crawlers Ranking:\nKM > S&S/Descent > Gloomhaven",

I find the game to be thematically nonsensical, the story to be tedious and forgettable, and the combat to be a dull, static puzzle that rewards planning complete, optimal solutions over active turn-by-turn play.\n\nI find it obnoxious that the basic combat mechanic is \"taking actions takes away your actions.\" Failure usually has nothing to do with whether your characters are defeated in combat, or whether you faced overwhelming odds and made actual poor choices, but whether you successfully optimized.\n\nThen there are the actions themselves. Imagine D&D where your wizard's spell either \"does 4 radiant damage and you fall prone OR turns lead to chocolate and you move 5 feet\". There's nothing to relate these things except that you have to choose between them. This is how every Gloomhaven card works. The effect is to make the game purely puzzle solving, and all theme and story is dispensable. They do nothing for each other. You're not \"fulfilling your quest\". You're prioritizing your resources in advance and then taking an hour to see if you optimized properly.",

Upgrading your cards require hundreds of gold and even the hardest scenario rewards + loot yield you around 50 if you are with a fast moving looter character. The slow movers are left out of the shopping party which is demotivating and frustrating. You can't freely trade loot between each other, why? I always felt an invisible barrier here which can be neglected by farming random scenarios - no, thank you.\nQuests are repetitve or some harder main quests require special setup, if you don't have you fail miserable.

I love PC games like XCom and Frozen Synapse and Card Hunter but none of those feel as much like a puzzle as this does. None of those make me feel boxed into making specific choices. While tactical at heart, those feel more chess like, in that I must asses what my opponent is likely to do and think ahead or do something unexpected to bait out my opponent. I'm not doing precise calculations for every single action.\n\nI think most people are aware of the long setup, the high price, and the level of complexity that this game comes with. These are not deal breakers for this game. It seems to be the core gameplay design that dooms this game from the start, no matter how great the story, and no matter how varied the content.\n\nDoes it deserve to be at #1? I don't see how something that seems more like an activity than a game could be so high up the list. Do yourself a favor and try out the inexpensive digital version first before you decide to buy the big box based on BGG ratings alone.",

For a game with so much toy factor, the thematic elements feel lost in the bland tiles. It's difficult to evoke theme with minis alone.\n\nIt amounts to just another RPG on rails, but with a save state which works well enough for your typical \"legacy\" style game. It attempts, but ultimately fails, at allowing more than a single party to play the game.\n\nIt has some interesting mechanics. Unfortunately, the mechanics clash. The player elimination fights the cooperative game play which fight the constant reduction of choices which often lead to one player having absolutely no choice but to sacrifice themselves and sit on the sidelines. When a game offers no choices, it's not a game.\n\nMy Opinion: Play an RPG. You'll have more fun and save yourself a lot of money. Toy factor aside, something you can easily remedy by choosing minis for your RPGs, you can customize the game to your liking, use tiles if you wish.",

    "comment": "This game was a disappointment for my group. Granted, if you like the core puzzle, there is a lot of content, but our group did not find it particularly engaging. There are several compounding issues:\n1) Setup and general management of components is time-consuming and clunky. Constantly shuffling decks and teardown/setup adds way too much overhead to actual game ratio.\n2) Rules for cooperation/competition with your team feel floaty and obnoxious. The idea that you can only vaguely hint at what timeframe your action plays slows down the game and doesn't feel satisfying- we are aware there are rules for allowing full action information with your teammates, but the developers stress this is not the intended way to play the game.\n3) Core combat puzzle is OK. We played 4 missions, and never felt like we were in a really tough spot or made really great moves; the system didn't feel like it lent itself to those sorts of plays. When things weren't looking our way, it was frequently because of a string of bad card draws from one of our players, leading more to a feeling of annoyance rather than feeling like we had more to learn in the system. It reminded me a lot of D&D combat in this way.\n4) Story felt like typical fantasy and didn't grip us. We went to a LAVA MOUNTAIN and felt bored- something was wrong. Again, I'm sure there was more interesting plot development down the road, but the game failed to pull us into its narrative. The decisions we made along the road didn't feel interesting, and seemed to come from the Fable school of morality (e.g, do you want to steal this guys stuff while he takes a leak, or be friendly).\n\nLastly, I want to say that people aren't wrong from enjoying this game, or that there isn't fun to be had. We just feel there are games with a better core combat puzzle, and while the legacy format adds a lot, to us it just feels like a slog through the overuse of this puzzle; if you want to know a game we have a high opinion of in the combat-puzzle space, Mage Knight is one of our favorite games.\n\nSimply put, this is a game with an OK combat puzzle and tons of content, but it does not deserve it's number one spot for so long, and we have no desire of playing it again.",

What I experienced in Gloomhaven was a few funky mechanics wrapped in an excessive amount of blandly decorated cardboard. I was uninspired by its generic setting.\n\nIf you combined together the best card mechanics from Gloomhaven and Mage Knight, supplied one hundred properly sculpted miniatures and presented the campaign set in an engaging non-generic universe then I’d be inclined to feel engaged in the game experience. The game is crunchy in terms of its weight. There is more complexity imbedded with its design than other dungeon based board games. The pace is a slow grinding configuration of unrewarding meaty decisions.\n\nGloomhaven is a generously sized package filled with surprises which included a lack of attention to detail in two fundamental areas; 1. Quality miniature sculpting 2. Forgetting to bring talented fantasy artists in to illustrate all its blank cards and other mundane components.\n\nIt’s lazy roleplaying, straight out of the box, hence the immediate popularity spawned by convenience. If I was feeling too lazy for a pen & paper campaign and wanted something easier to unbox with nicer art and a lovely selection of models to collect and paint then I’d be waiting for the relaunch of HeroQuest.\n\nGloomhaven is even more plain than its unimaginative title suggests, so it’s never going to be my fantasy campaign game of choice. I’d always prefer to be adventuring in somewhere drenched in tomes of arcane lore that matters. Somewhere like Mordheim.",

In Gloomhaven, all revolves around turn-based combat driven by a cardplay-centric ressource engine. It's not a proper adventure where characters interact with the world.\n\nAfter playing ca. six scenarios, it became clear that the campaign is a framework for the combat loop. There was no engagement in co-creation, no playing at the world. There are card upgrades and persistent legacy elements, but after >15 hours it seemed to me that dumping characters and getting new ones is what \"progression\" mostly means in the context of this game. The scenarios are not interesting either (kick in door & kill boss). Maybe world building and development becomes more of a subject if one is 50 hours into the campaign, but I will not take my chances and find out.\n\nI find the gameplay is quite a chore. Tactical combat isn't really super challenging either. The AI is quite simple and easy to beat, which isn't a plus in my book for this sort of game. If one truly wants turn based tactical miniature combat, there are actual tactical wargames for that.",

The card play/progression is great but the missions are so damn repetitive and boring the deeper you go. This is really just a case of a game overstaying it's welcome.",

Also difficult to actually do a full campaign or even a shorter one without a dedicated playgroup, which I don't have.\n\nI tried the app for a bit, but its just not my kind of game. If I play an app of a dungeon crawler, I'd just pick a JRPG or other video game and not a BG adaptation. And then when it comes to BGs of semi dungeon crawlers like this one, I'm just a bigger fan of competitive euro games than dungeon crawls where you worry about # of movement spaces and # of attack hit points and RNG of stuff like what's the modifier/card to be drawn. There's often a bunch of small rules governing monster movement, attacks, etc, which bogs the game down and doesn't feel elegant.\n\nSo, it's overall not the kind of game for me, and there's just always so many rules in these kinds of dungeon crawler games (I felt semi similar with games like Star Wars Imperial Assault). 40/100\n\nCan look up JotL for updated Gloomhaven thoughts.",

    "comment": "Dungeon crawl game with a bit of a legacy game feel. The core mechanisms are relatively simple to play there are some rules that require referring back to the book at times. Card play feels a lot like Mage Knight but far less irritating as you can play any card for a basic move/attack action. At the end of the day though, it's just a hack-and-slash game where you move and attack over and over again until everything is dead or you've run out of cards; it just feels like an absolute slog. While I'm used to random combat from D&D/Pathfinder and having a personal combat modifier deck is a neat idea, the randomness of combat in this irritates me as the best laid plans can be blown away by 1 bad card draw. With RPGs you can react to a fluid situation whereas Gloomhaven requires you to plan your part ahead of time without knowing how things will be situated when it becomes your turn to act, and you can have a turn completely go to shit because another player or NPC acted before you and changed the state of the board. I hate the losing a card from your hand when you rest mechanic which serves as a rather heavy-handed game timer; run out of cards and you're forced to retire from the scenario. Did you lose your one remaining good card for this scenario? Too bad unless you want to give up the few HP you have left because everything has been attacking you. Hahaha, hope you like trying the same scenario setup the same way again! In something so combat focused, this seems rather harsh. Personal goal cards are randomly dealt out at the start of each scenario and you can get stuck with a card that is almost impossible to complete for your particular character which makes advancement tedious. Not being able to share gold is also incredibly irritating; the rules basically say you're a group of mercenaries who are in it just for themselves and refuse to share with one another - you're just together as a group as a matter of convenience. If a character satisfies their overall personal objective, they just leave the group and get replaced by another character. Killed all the baddies? Sure hope you looted all of that treasure because while the scenario had ZERO urgency, you can't take the few minutes necessary to round up that loot and you're forced to leave everything you didn't collect behind because reasons. There are some good idea in here but the majority of the game just irritates the hell out of me. Childres' first game, Forge War, was an infinitely more enjoyable experience in my books.",

Also, since the game is non-linear and full of side quests, I lost track of any semblance of story long ago. Also, characters level at an anemic pace to try to dangle some amount of carrot in front of players.\n\nTo not force players to play the same character for so long, players can retire characters as they complete personal quests, except personal quests are horribly balanced. Some are trivial to complete, others take a long time or are literally impossible, depending on how far you are in the story. Also, since parties are composed of characters of different levels and still need to feel fun for everyone, characters don't get super powerful over the course of the game. Level ups tend to give you cards that are either basic cards with a number increased by 1 or are cool effects but single use, meaning you are giving up survivability for power. Similarly, items are very limited use and, as you level up, you just get items that are slightly better.\n\nFor me, after getting through about 1/3 of the campaign, half of the group was so miserable, that we were on the verge of not wanting to play together anymore.",

It really is just hilariously grind-y.\n—-\nThe fact that this overwrought monstrosity is #1 on BGG now seems like it should say a lot about where the hobby is now. Gloomhaven is pretty mediocre. It’s a total by-the-numbers design, with limited interest either narratively or tactically. It doesn’t have much of a sense of pacing or narrative direction. It doesn’t have an answer to the question of why it exists. As I say below, it’s total consumerism run amok; way too much physical product for the limited range of the game itself.\n\nBut it seems to have taken off; I assume on the strength of peoples’ affection for D&D back in the day (if they’re older) or MMORPGs (if they’re less old).\n\nI think the reason I despair to some degree is that Gloomhaven is just such an uninteresting and unambituous piece of design and world building work. While certainly there is a lot of dreck in the boardgame space, there are also just so many people doing really interesting, thoughtful, and even meaningful games: Reiner Knizia’s Beowulf or Lord of the Rings, Spirit Island, Quartermaster General in all its incarnations, Catan in all its range and variety, Pandemic, Mystic Vale, Oath, the list goes on … that this relative mediocrity with little interesting to do or say is the #1 game on this site I think speaks to the problems in the hobby and, possibly, American society writ large.\n—-\nSo, I finally played this - 5 years late, well past when anyone cares about my opinion I’m sure. Still, I’ll put a few words down here.\n\nFirstly, in this age of impending environmental catastrophe, the amount of stuff in this box is just absolutely criminal. It’s not a bad game, but it’s a game of repetitive stabbing with very limited range. How many times is clearing similar dungeons really fun? The designer has focussed on quantity over quality here, which might have been fine in the 80s but in the 2010s and 2020s we all know what is going to happen here if developed countries don’t moderate their consumption, or at the very least get smarter about it. It’s going to be quite bad. This is a pretty grotesque example of Western consumerism.\n\nSo for me personally, I just find the dungeon crawler genre of accumulating body count kind of dumb. Neither D&D nor its many copycat computer games are things I’ve ever been deeply involved in, and the raw amount of personally killing sentient beings for extremely unclear reasons does not sit particularly well. So a game in this category really has to bring it to win me over. Gloomhaven can probably work for people who have a pre-existing sympathy for the format. If you require it to do more than scratch a nostalgic itch, though? Probably not. It has the same failings as all the games in this genre: super-repitive, grind-y, minimally thematic, and of limited narrative interest. It’s a lot more interesting than the previous entry in this genre that I got significant exposure to, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. But that’s a low bar; that game was quite bad.",

Moves quickly enough after a few turns, but often the writing is tiny and really hard to read, as are many of the symbols and pictures in the rules. The key card mechanism is classic self-convolution - decisions and tradeoffs for their own sake, not because they seem to make sense as choices in a real situation. After three rooms, you've worked out the character type, from then on it's just slog though reasonably pleasurable with friends. Would be a favourite if I were looking for a game that takes as long as possible to play, but though I would not mind coming back to it (if I don't have to do the setup sorting), I don't see what the hullabaloo is about. I dislike the undeclared legacy nature of the game, though apparently there are components that mitigate it. It does feel like Baldur's Gate redone as a boardgame, which is technically a compliment but really just means that the design is quite literalist as compared to someone who thinks about making a good boardgame.\n\nSummary: Storm of bits, made painful by the silly card mechanic.

And, that is just from the gameplay! The story took you along a path that seemed to match the use and personalities of the characters we made. Every time we played felt like we were on an adventure curing pandemic diseases like “stupidity.”\n\nI thought Gloomhaven, with its super high rating and rave reviews would give me the same feeling, for a longer time. It never did.\n\nI didn’t realize that the story was largely of your own making. It was a tactics game rolled up in an adventure subtext. I didn’t know the story took a backseat to the fighting. It is a tactics game first, role playing second. Unlike D&D which has the Tick’s “drama power” where your story can change, and the nature of encounters is more fluid, Gloomhaven is set.\n\nI respect the people that can squeeze joy out of this lemon.

It's not an enjoyable game arc. Most games you're building an engine to get more and more powerful, here you're just getting weaker and weaker. Every scenario is a ticking time bomb and the prospect of losing and having to repeat it feels so terrible.\n\nAlso, a badly timed x2 or null card can destroy your scenario.\n\nThis game is really just tactical card play. You can get a similar experience in a much lighter package in Watergate (which has the similar 'use a card for regular powers' or 'lose it for a more powerful action'). And really, I more enjoy the tense card play of lost cities.\n\nPerhaps some people get really into the campaign, but for me the massive space hog and mind hog of this game makes the okay play not worth it at all.",

Well, that is Gloomhaven for me.\n\nI own this game on Steam - and nowadays I keep trying to convince myself I was drunk when I bought it.\n\nThe digital version plays pretty much like the boardgame, so it IS a good way to experience the game without investing a ton of money on the tabletop version; however, it is just a mediocre dungeon crawler at its core. The art is likeable, but not amazing; gameplay is okayish (in both versions, with pros and cons when comparing both); the campaign is nothing new... nothing in it is really, really bad, but absolutely nothing is mind blowing. Regarding the digital version, soundtrack and narrations are good, but again, nothing that spectacular.\n\nWhy is this the best board game ever according to BGG? My best shot is that it appeals to people that would like to play tabletop RPG Dungeon Crawlers but don't have the time or impetus to actually do it. Is it better than those mentioned Old School Dungeon Crawlers? Absolutely not. Now, when it comes to the digital version, besides testing to know the game, I can't really understand why you would invest hundreds of hours into this game instead of playing any one of the better Dungeon Crawlers RPGs on PC out there (not to mention you won't have much of a deep story here by comparison to even the Dungeon Crawlers for PC of the 90s).\n\nI know you will find a ton of positive reviews in this section, that's the nature of this beast, but here I am leaving you with a counterpoint and a message of support so you don't have to feel bad to pass on this title.\n\nSo there you have it, I confess, I don't like the \"best ranked board game on Board Game Geek\".",

Do not expect too much character development between games unless you take significant liberties with treasure and xp rules. It's not a particularly thematic game either. The main 'story' is threadbare and linear and doesn't qualify for me as 'passable' narrative experience. The legacy aspects are mostly superficial and are more akin to a video game trophy collection than anything truly impactful to your journey through the extraordinarily long scenario book.\n\nDoes this sound strange given how people talk about Gloomhaven? Well, people have a habit of locking in their first impressions and don't allow the passage of time and other games opportunity to claim the throne (probably because they've invested 300hours+ into this slog). At the time of release, Gloomhaven broke campaign/narrative ground. Now, it feels shallow in its progress and obtuse in its rule application.\n\nAS A PUZZLE GAME, I'd say Gloomhaven is still \"good\", middle of the road, passible, and I would enjoy a few plays every month for a long time, but there is nominal difference between the 100+ scenarios - read; puzzles - and what little difference there is comes mostly comes from character progression (which, as previously noted, is slow and not nearly as strong as in other games). Honestly, I think you'd be just as well served and have a similar itch scratched by a sudoku book - which wouldn't cost $150 or take 30mins set up and 30mins tear down (I bought an insert which was absolutely essential; this games' box and insert gets a 0/10; the set up and tear down is that unacceptable in the face of recent Gametrayz production meta developments).\n\nIn 2017 Gloomhaven blew people's minds. I say that if it was released now that it wouldn't break the top 300. In the end, I binned the game but kept the character decks, models I painted, and good item cards, which I may put into Jaws of the Lion to spice it up into the game this always should have been.",

I found it to be a multiplayer puzzle and accounting game.\n\nI like technical/accounting games, but it isn't what I look for in a dungeon crawl. In a dungeon crawl, I like playing a character and will keep track of odds to make sure I don't do something really, really, really stupid. The game mechanics forced me to play extremely out of character. I was a spell caster (Spellweaver) who was forced to leap (game mechanics \"jump\") through the entire crowd of final monsters in the first scenario to make the rest of the party attack, instead of taking it slow and picking opportunities.\n\nYou are forced to play cards or permanently loose cards every turn, sometimes both. There is a maximum limit to how many rounds a character can play before they are simply removed from the board. How you play and luck can reduce the theoretical maximum limit of rounds. The limit is not the same for every character and mine appeared to be the shortest. So I leaped in while half the party took a long rest (game mechanic), because I only had two rounds before I would have one card left and removed from the game. This is even though I was at full health.\n\nI say I don't like it and I payed well enough to come out at the end with no damage, grabbing the main treasure, tied for second place for who picked up the most gold and I had the most XP (16 not counting the amount you get for completing scenario successfully). We did win on the first try with everyone still standing.\n\nFor a dungeon crawl, I would choose Mice and Mystic over Gloomhaven, because Gloomhaven can be more about card management/accounting than playing a character through a story.\n\nThat said, have fun and make sure everyone else does also.",

While I understand the charm among people who like their \"RPG-lite\" adventure games the modern way (classic Ameritrash adventure made out of Euro mechanics), this is exactly the turnoff for me. The hand management gameplay, while mechanically kind of clever, makes every scenario a race, kill the monsters or reach a certain spot before you've had to discard down to one action card per character. As for optimization exercises disguised as adventures, I enjoyed Mage Knight a lot more at least for a solitaire game.\nThe scenarios are repetitive as well, kill all enemies, kill the boss, or move your characters to target hexes and that's it. Nothing really original in the story or the cliched fantasy world. Subpar punchboard quality for a game this expensive.\nFor lovers of the legacy mechanic Gloomhaven delivers, and I guess this is the main selling point. Clearly a lot of thought has gone to the characters' leveling up mechanics, and there are LOADS of ways to improve your skills. So at least that part of the hype is deserved.",

But most of the time when I think about playing it I then think about the setup time and the book keeping during play and I mostly end up playing Mage Knight instead which is set up in less than a 1/4 of the time and feels way more epic most of the time. We also started out as a group of four and one didn't like the game so we ended up being three and there is a \"dangling\" character now that is partly developed/spoiled. Also this game demands loads of time from the playing group. I want to play it more often but then the group has no time and you cannot really play it solo if you don't want to level up too much (and make it harder for everyone by this) and/or spoil other characters that the group (or you) might want to play later. This game has created a dilemma for me and is sitting on my shelve now because of this. This is a bummer because otherwise it is a gorgeous game with good mechanics.",

    "comment": "Kickstarter. Tactical dungeon crawler for 1-4 players. Okay as a solitare, best at 2-3 (4 is a bit crowded, and slow). Legacy games are not for me - I prefer games where you finish in one session. That being said this game is still okay. Rules are a bit complicated - some of the stuff could easily have been removed without affecting anything seriously. Beeing cooperative you can skip a lot and it's quite easy to teach others to play if you stick to the basics. Setup time is far to long though. There are lots of components (tons of stuff that's only used once) but variation is still quite low - each game is very similar to the previous one, making it slightly boring after a while. I will play this mainly solo, and only sporadically with others. Rating it at 6.\n\nNovember 2020: I now have Jaws of the Lion. It's better in every way. I will probably never play original Gloomhaven again. Lowering rating to 4.",

    "comment": "Gloomhaven is D&D for eurogamers; it has slow incremental growth, character customization, and of course skull smashing. And Gloomhaven ports a lot of this quite well. The characters are unique and inviting, the world is evocative and new, and the card powers are fun from the start and only grow stronger with time. Most notable is the action selection mechanism which feeds into a palpable feeling of stamina drain as cards slowly leak out your deck and the scenario creeps to its conclusion. The problem is that Gloomhaven isn't fun. Despite all of its strengths, Gloomhaven is an overly protracted slog with unrelenting bookkeeping. I am a fan of heavy euros, but never has a game felt as laborious or as tedious as Gloomhaven. Even with my friend who'd setup the games in advance, and automate enemy damage/effect tracking, the game felt horribly burdensome. After six scenarios we called it quits and returned to the plethora of other games that bring us joy.",

    "comment": "Let me start with this: Gloomhaven has an outstanding combat system. It's fun to play, rewards good tactics and strategy, and continuously throws interesting decisions at you. If it only was for its core, Gloomhaven would be a 9/10 game, only despite a few issues that can be lived with.\n\nHowever, every single other aspect of the game is an absolute disaster. I'd rate these aspects a 3/10, so the average is 6/10.\n\n- The progression system is flawed by nature. You get XP for playing certain cards and as a reward for completing certain quests. If you get enough XP, you level up. You get a nice new card and a perk for your attack modifier deck. That's terrific. The problem is how the game system responds to the players leveling up. It just increases the monsters' stats. This, combined with the fact that items and sticker upgrades don't count towards your character level (and they can MASSIVELY improve your character, even more than leveling up) makes the game easier as you progress. You will reach a certain point where the characters are too powerful. Fanatics always answer this saying that you can change the difficulty level to compensate that. That's recognising that the game isn't properly balanced.\n\n- Retiring characters feels wrong to me. You've spent weeks building your character to a point you really enjoy using it. And someday, even by accident, you will complete your personal quest and be stripped of your beloved character. That just feels wrong. I know that the game encourages trying new classes, but it shouldn't impose it to you. Fanatics defend this system saying that you can perfectly create a new class of the same character you had. But you have to start again at a lower level, depending on the city's prosperity. This means that you've just lost all your items, most of your perks, and several levels. This, combined with the above point, makes progress undesirable. The fact that game dynamics punish progression is bad.\n\n- But wait, retiring characters unlock really cool new classes. The unlockable classes are one of the worst aspects of the game. They are terribly unbalanced, with most of them overpowering the starting six, or being so niche that low player counts can unlock classes with total anti-synergies between each other. The whole progression system is just wrong. Team composition should be more in the hands of the players. It's nice to unlock new classes to try out different things, but forcing the players to change characters feels wrong. It's more problematic in low player counts.\n\n- The story is pretty generic, but I don't play games for the story.\n\n- Scenario design is wildly inconsistent. You have a couple great scenarios, highlighting the most simples: just kill every enemy on the board. That's the best kind of scenario. You have variety in the map layout, the monsters it has and, of course, your team composition. However, sadly most of the scenarios are poorly designed. Bosses are way too swingy, and so are the summoning enemies. They turn the game into a coin toss: if you get lucky, you may win easily. If you get unlucky, the game may be unwinnable. This phenomena also appears in many scenarios that can be way too random. And others can be cheesed with easy strats.\n\n- Everything outside combat is pretty flawed as well. City and Road events are one of my most despised game mechanic: making uninformed choices. If you already know the game, you can memorise the events and make the best choice. Also, the fact that some decisions require certain classes to have a good effect, and the fact that this information is hidden, is just wrong. Events add nothing in terms of game mechanics, but if you like role playing you may like them, but this is not a game for role players, as the combat system is a brain burner. Battle goals are nice in theory, but everybody ends up revealing what they have to do. \"Let me open that door\" or \"Let me kill that enemy\" are common phrases within this game. Finally, legacy elements, in particular the closed envelopes, add nothing relevant. It's just hiding content for the sake of hiding it.\n\nThis game has the foundations of what the community claims it to be: the best board game ever. However, everything that surrounds the great combat system, which I had lots of fun with it, takes away the overall enjoyment of the game.",

    "comment": "So I will preface this by saying that because Gloomhaven is so hyped, I came in with very high expectations which may be a bit unfair. And was only able to play a couple scenarios. But at the end of the day I was really underwhelmed.\nObviously the positive of Gloomhaven is it is a big box full of a lot of components that can entertain an individual or group pretty much indefinitely. There is almost no limit to the amount you can milk this game for, so I understand the appeal. Also, from an economic and mechanical perspective I can appreciate the game. Your figurines are very nice, and from a financial perspective, making the rest of the components cardboard makes sense. And the monster cards that can easily scale difficulty for your needs are a brilliant idea.\nHowever, I had a lot of gripes. First, set up was an absolute chore. It took us twice as long to set up as it did to play the actual scenario. This could be mitigated if you could leave it permanently set up somewhere, but is absolutely prohibitive for a normal game night. Second, some of the mechanics were interesting and sort of fun. But the fact that you have to spend your valuable action cards whether you want to or not is thematically and mechanically obnoxious and silly. For example, I had to waste two entire turns (and therefore burn 4 of my dwindling action cards) just walking across a large room. I'm not quite sure why that mechanic exists, but it bothered me to no end. Likewise, there was a pit trap blocking a door. There is no way to disarm it in the game (besides jumping or pushing enemies into it, which my character couldn't do), so my character just had to walk over it and take damage. So for both of these fairly basic tasks that could be solved by some light exercise and critical thinking skills, my character was severely and illogically punished.\nFinally, and in summary, I guess my take away is that Gloomhaven is basically a mash up of a DnD game and a Zombicide game, and it is far, far worse than either of those. If you want role playing dungeon crawling, Dnd is far richer and more fun. If you want a simple monster bashing game with your friends, Zombicide Black Plague is far easier to set up, more tense, and narratively interesting than Gloomhaven.\nI guess in the end, the best use of Gloomhaven I can think of is if a person who doesn't have a game group can just set it up permanently on a big table at their house and just play alone when he/she has time. It just doesn't feel worth it to bring it out for even semi regular use for a group.",

I still have the box it shipped in as I figured I was going to be reselling it. That won't be the case though... no sirree, I'm playing this game again tomorrow and maybe a few more times this week\n\nGloomhaven surprised me, not because it's a good game, but because it's actually pretty streamlined! Given the box is the size of my torso and punching the boards takes a full hour I was expecting some really complicated game that was a bear to play, but the play is super smooth and the phase order is so simple: play 2 cards, determine initiative, play turns in initiative order, rinse/repeat. The rulebook was admittedly intimidating, but things are relatively intuitive once you get going. I found it simpler to learn than both Descent and Mage Knight and it seems to do imitations of both very well\n\nDon't get me wrong though; there are a lot of nuances in this game. If you haven't played games like Descent and Mage Knight then it might be a good idea to start there to properly appreciate how the core ideas of those games has been incorporated here. This at its heart is a cooperative game and as such it is missing some of the finer competitive elements of its predecessors. Then again Mage Knight and Descent hardly ever hit the table unless I'm playing solo, so we're not losing much\n\nSo the tactical dungeon crawling of Descent and the puzzly hand management of Mage Knight. What else is here? Robinson Crusoe's returning consequences is here too with the presence of travel events. There's an AI that is somehow even better than Gears of Wars's excellent AI system. I'm sure I'm missing a few others, but I'd say those together make up the core\n\nThe game is puzzly and thinky but not overbearing with process, and that makes it a slam dunk. Each class is complex and intricate with clear overarching strategies. Each kind of reminds me of a class in a MMORPG. Moreover, I've only played with two so far (both of which I'm thoroughly impressed with) and there are 15 more! What the heck?? I just got 4 hours of play from one session with these two and I haven't even scratched the surface with these characters. The amount of legitimately interesting content here is staggering\n\nGloomhaven just has to be a 10 for me. This is the perfect tactical dungeon crawl (unless you want something with a DM, then play Descent). There are a lot of effects but they are all relatively straightforward. There is a lot going on, but a good teacher could very easily abstract away the details from you. I love the classes and I love the puzzly nature of it all\n\nI will criticize it for a few things though: first there's way too much stuff here. The game is starting to rival my Netrunner collection in terms of how I need to find ways to systematically manage it all efficiently. And I just opened the game. Moreover, sifting through cards during setup, digging through bags of tokens - it all really adds up. The game is not short by any means. My learning game took around 4 hours which included searching for clarifications on BGG. I don't see this ever taking less than two hours. Lastly, I should clarify: this game feels streamlined to me compared to other similar heavy games. There's still a lot of rules and a good amount going on - I just find it easier to remember than in other games which tend to have more branching conditions\n\nOverall though, I'm extremely impressed with Gloomhaven. It far exceeded my expectations and I look forward to playing it again\n\nEDIT: I've gotten to play about 10 games so far and wanted to update my thoughts. So far I'm still really enjoying the game although I think it's just shy of perfect for me. All of my plays have been solo playing two characters although I just introduced a third character on my most recent play.\n\nThe good: lots and lots of content, tactically very rich, streamlined phases, interesting characters, challenging, not a lot of rules referencing mid-play, progression is well-tuned and compelling, enemies require different strategies, clean and strong AI\n\nThe meh: bookkeeping is fiddly, attack modifier decks are cool but fiddly, long playtime, pacing seems a little slow considering how long fights take, a few of the scenario elements seem like they don't add enough value to justify their overhead (prosperity, reputation, events), you need to work if you don't want to legacy-ify your copy, rulebook is passable but not excellent, the randomness is tableflip-inducing at times\n\nI tried out a few apps and am really happy with Esoteric Software's web app for managing combat. It let me toss all of the enemy cards/trackers and the character dials back in the box forever and has easily shaved 30m-1h off of the playtime for me. It's let me pick up a third character without much trouble and I don't think a fourth would even be too much\n\nOverall I really love the game - my biggest complaints would be the bookkeeping and the pacing. It's a little frustrating to see two hours go by and realize you've only cleared two rooms but that's the cost of such a detailed and puzzly game. Still a winner, just knocked down a half point\n\nEDIT: This is a great game. I was really into it when I first got it. I've cooled on it a bit because of how long and taxing it is, but I always enjoy myself when I get it to the table. I'm not sure if it's better than Descent. Downtime waiting for others to take turns and long setup really drag this down for me\n\nEDIT: No real desire to come back to it",

I really enjoyed my time with it, but a third of the scenarios feel underbaked, and it is a strange case of there simply being too much for a tabletop format.\n\nThe cardplay is great fun, and I'm glad other games have similar systems that work a bit better (Pavlov's House), the characters are very interesting and do play differently, and I think the shoddy-but-fun writing hits on the 1980s Fighting Fantasy novels some of us grew up around.\n\nBut it's too much. It is full of fluff like varying-similar enemy types with not enough to differentiate them; you don't need multiple decks of cards for them, add optional \"flavour\" cards into the existing Skeleton deck or something instead?\n\nIt's heavy, bulky, and very impressive. But with distance and time to think on the positive and negatives, there is some truth to the video game version being a much better experience. The board game replicating some notable dungeon crawler video games is telling, but the writing isn't good enough so it doesn't stand up to actual high quality tabletop RPGs, and the scenarios can be actually pointless and mundane copies of other mundane scenarios.\n\nA great achievement, but with all important distance, I'd rather play a more refined game. I'm not spending 30 hours on a character's personal life goal card ever again, certainly. That sums up the rough edges of Gloomhaven.\n\nAs a side note, I enjoy the pretty grand Founders of Gloomhaven. If you get a chance, give that a go! I would love to see Isaac do more away from dungeon crawler campaigns due to Founders of Gloomhaven.",

    "comment": "Really wanted to love this game, but over time the cracks started to appear. After about the 10th play session, I created a document for things I didn't like as a way to brainstorm house-rules to fix them. They might be crap but figured I would post it as it highlights the issues I have with the game.\nMajor Issues:\n1) Upkeep and admin during play – Keeping track of events during play is a necessary, but should be reduced to its simplest form and should be combined to incorporate the major mechanics of your game. You can have many changes during gameplay as rounds/turns are completed. But it is necessary to create a system that changes the same things every time a round is complete. If you have a combat system that could include magic, special abilities, or experience points, then 1 mechanic should be included that does all of these things. For example: Magic the gathering is one of the most varied and complex games there are, but the foundations are the same for most games.\n- Roll for who goes first and then turn order is determined clock wise. This is established at the beginning and continues until the end. You Upkeep your board (turning everything active again, draw a card, and usually playing a land. Follow the same steps everytime to complete your turn. The mechanics are the same across the board but a simple combination of letting the player play specific cards in a specific order at a specific time, greatly adds variety without changing the core order of how things go. Once you have the basics, you build on that.\n2) Repeatability should emphasized in the rules as well as the content. Combat should be the same across the board on who goes first, enemy movement, and attack patterns. However, fighting the same creatures that do the same thing every time or adding more of the same enemy or elite versions does not add more fun. Do not have the same enemies for consecutive missions or quests. For example, if you only have 10 different enemy types, you can easily make them stronger as the game progresses. But do not make the players fight 4 consecutive scenarios with different variations of the same enemy. For example, after completing 4 scenarios in Gloomhaven, we fought skeletons (move 1-2 spaces, attack range or melee) Bandits (move 1-2 spaces, attack range or melee) Marauders (move 1-3 spaces, attack range or melee). This is the same enemy with a different name.\n3) Make events thematically correct. Don’t include stupid missions like helping a kid find is cat, becoming exhausted from doing so and then removing experience points the player has gained from previous missions. That makes no sense. Have a negative consequence relate to the situation (while looking for the cat in the abandon warehouse, you stepped on nail and take damage, or have to go last in initiative, or have no movement on your turn.\n4) Give all players the ability to revive or safe their teammates. For fucks sakes Gloomhaven’s system could have 1 party member get attacked by 2 enemies and go down and be out of the scenario completely. Then the player has to sit there and watch. At least give each player the ability to save their friends and bring them back once a scenario.\n5) Give the players basics they can fall back on that actually matter. Don’t let them just move 2 and attack for 2 if they can’t use their abilities. Let them double their movement, or double their attack, or Heal themselves or their teammates for a small amount. Some times moving 2 and attacking for 2 does nothing when enemies are 4 spaces away and your party is being slaughtered.\n6) Encourage tactics and cooperation. Do not state in the rules that they have to be vague on what they are going to do. This is confusing and discourages players from working together to maximize their efforts and leaves each player fending for themselves and only encourages the maximum play for the individual. When its obviously more satisfying to play weaker cards that could boost the effect of a member of your party.\n7) Make rewards simple. If your system rewards gold for killing an enemy, then do not make them sacrifice their turn or action just to collect that loot. (In Gloomhaven, you can also be robbed on the road and loose everything you worked for). Incorporate picking up the loot in their actions. Do make them use an action to “Loot” or end their turn on that square to pick it up. Let them easily collect the reward by having to at least touch that square during their movement.\n8) Don’t gatekeep powerful items. In Gloomhaven, you only have access to a pool of items that is based on party’s reputation. Fuck that, not only does that not make sense thematically (Why would a vendor care who buys an item if they have the coin) but it also railroads the players. Make the really powerful items really expensive so if the party wants to pool their gold and buy that one item to do something cool, let them. Make one time use items cheap to purchase but focus on permanent items they can keep and build over time. These items can complement the exact build they are looking for.\n9) Use dice, not cards for variety. Instead of making 50 different decks for modifiers, create a system that uses dice to add bonuses for combat. Dice, like a standard D&D starter, can be customized for each character type and can even be used outside of playing your game. There are too many cards that need to be in order and numbered at the bottom for each character and enemy and is completely unnecessary. You can scale level progression by the type of dice used. Oh, your level 5 now, so your attack bonus is a d6 instead of a d4. Gloomhaven will want separate piles of cards for each modifier. Also, the board gamer type will always appreciate and see the value of more dice. Not paper cards that are ruined with one drink spill.\n10) Make level progression meaningful. Gloomhaven, I received 1 more extra point for HP, got to pick 1 card that had to replace 1 card from my hand but still only had 10 cards to choose from. No new items in the shop.\n11) Let players swap items or loot unconscious party member items during gameplay. How dumb is it that a player could have a potion of healing they didn’t get to take before going down or unable to give that to another party member that may need it to finish the scenario.\n12) Cardboard is inferior to laminated paper maps. For fucks sakes Gloomhaven has cardboard cutouts to link together with different sides and digging for some symbol on the underside of another. Then provides punch out cardboard for traps or other things to add to those pieces that get moved around during gameplay anyway. I know this is for adjusting the level of difficulty based on the number of players but why not create a scalability difficulty not based on the terrain. For example, have the same traps in a given dungeon, just have them do less damage or reduce the effects they have. Its dumb to build a difficulty system based the number of environmental factors as it is to adjust their impact. You could laminate 25 paper maps, with different dungeons on the underside and have 50 unique locations that already have everything set up besides the enemy locations. You can even design them so that they connect on either end as the story progresses. This would protect the maps from mildew or liquid damage and make it easier to set up each scenario. You can also control the quality of the art, so door ways look like doors, instead of an off centered punchout of cardboard art that looks like a rock.\n13) Status effects should go on the mini and combat board, not the life tracker of each enemy. Everyone is looking at the board, stop wasting peoples time by planning a whole turn around an enemy who might attack and kill your teammate to find out after doing damage that they couldn’t attack in the first place. Little circles that go around the base, for fucks sake.\n14) If you are going to ask a consumer to pay $200 for a game with 9 plastic 3d minis and 100 cardboard cutouts for enemies, just increase the price and make all the minis be the same. Maybe offer 1 cheap option all cardboard cutouts and a more expensive version 3d printed but mashing the 2 together is stupid. 2d creatures can only be clearly identified at 2 angles and the artwork can only be appreciate 10% of the time. Reduce the cards, cardboard cutout maps, status effects, round markers, character sheets, number of enemy types, cheap Hp and exp counters and put that money into the 3d prints of minis that people can use again for a d&d campaign. Look at that, dice, 3d printed minis, and laminated maps that could be used even after the campaign has been completed.\n15) Don’t make characters that resemble starter characters in dnd with 8 HP and can be taken out easily in one round. Spread out the damage or effects so characters have the chance to intervene with their decisions. Nothing more annoying than 1 player with full HP attacking on their turn, to have a teammate go invisible and become the only target, and then be the only target for multiple enemies that can kill them in 1 round. That should not be the norm.\n16) Create an interesting core game inside the campaign that can be played in the future after the campaign has been finished. For fucks sakes, Azul is a great game with some tile pieces and core rules. Maybe a battle simulator or something.",

Again, and again, and again. It's fine, but I feel there's something lacking.

    "comment": "[Digital version review] One word comes to my mind when I think about Gloomhaven: meh. Everything about this game feels just meh. Although the core mechanism sounds interesting on paper, it can get repetitive quite early due of combos.\n\nFurthermore, some actions are very situational (destroying obstables, disarming traps) but very often they're discarded by the time you would actually need them and it's not really possible to plan this ahead because many things are hidden when you enter a map. While it is possible to repeat a map after defeat - where is the fun in repeating every single map before finishing it? Considering how crucial action management is in this game it probably would have been better to use open maps with very little to no hidden information.\n\nWriting of action management, I'm also not a fan of the \"automatic miss\" - attack modifier (you pull one out of a bag on each attack and they can be positive, neutral or negative) because misses can be tremendously punishing on big hits, if not scenario deciding.\n\nYour bag of modifiers is one of three things that you upgrade during level up. The leveling system in this game is meh, too, imhb. It takes a while to level up and then you get +1 hp, one new action card with which you can replace an old one, a \"perk\" that let's you change your bag of modifers a bit (but none let's you remove the miss!! *groan*). None of these are particulary interesting or make you feel stronger. There are also ways to buff you by spending gold (items, blessings) but none of them are intriguing or necessarily game deciding.\n\nStorytelling: also meh. It's your generic \"adventurers meet in a tavern and go fighting evil guys, looting stuff and repeat the process ad infinitum.\" The story has no real depth to it, it just sets up hundreds of skirmishes that feel pretty much the same.\n\nOverall, the mechanics had potential but the implementation is mediocre.",

    "comment": "Full disclosure: I've never played the physical version of Gloomhaven. This rating is a combination of playing through the entirety of the digital version and knowing how it translates to the tabletop.\n\nGloomhaven as a video game is a pretty solid 8/10. The interface could be better and it could better clarify some of the poor rules text it inherits from the board game, but it's polished and made with love for the original product. For the fraction of the price it costs it's a great time if you're looking for a dungeon crawl.\n\nWhere this goes sideways for the tabletop version of the game is the sheer volume of setup/teardown/enemy automation/rules enforcement that you lose, and knowing that a 2-3 character party still takes 40-60 minutes to play out average scenarios in the digital version. Tabletop Gloomhaven has to be the easiest game to repeatedly cheat at by accident simply because there's just too many things to keep straight for the duration of time you're going to be playing it. The puzzle/scenarios are not interesting enough to warrant 2-3 hours grinding away on each, and the rewards of unlocking new equipment or characters don't keep the experience as fresh as one might hope. Sure there's new complexity to discover, but I actually found starting new characters to be deeply unrewarding because of the power hit your party takes by losing so much equipment. Truthfully, the one advantage I can give the tabletop game over the digital version is that when the randomizer deck throws out complete garbage that would lead to extending a scenario several more rounds, you could choose to just ignore this overall bad feature (mechanically the randomness is good, but in practice the lows stand out far more than the highs) and save yourself a bunch of time cleaning up a scenario you know you've already won.\n\nYou could not pay me to play Gloomhaven the tabletop game. I understand how it can be appealing to a certain gamer or group, but this is not a game for your average person. If you have even a passing interest in Gloomhaven, buy the PC game instead.",

That either you commit fully to play this game as your lifestyle or better just skip it.\nI'm aware that some of the issues I've mentioned can be at least partially rectified by using app and buying an insert, but when I spend so much on a game I expect it to be playable right from the box and any extra money should be spend on expanding the game or deluxification, not just making it playable. I also object to base my rating on video game version. It can be amongst best video games ever made, but it is a video game then, not a board game. As a board game I don't like it.

There's moments of brilliance, but they're surrounded by oceans of mediocrity.\n\nThe writing is abysmal. Just god-awful. There's a noticable dearth of unique ideas. By your 20th-30th scenario you'll have seen almost all of the scenario patterns and enemies that you'll encounter. By your 3rd or 4th character you'll realize how similar they all are. Even with the fan expansion, battle goals will become tediously rote. Personal Quests are just a complete disaster from a design perspective, with no concern given to making sure all quest goals are completable at any point in the game. The Legacy element is pointless and tacked on, it should simply be a campaign. The rules are a mess, with strange design choices that are unintuitive or unnecessarily fiddly. The monster AI is simultaneously too dumb and too complicated to operate (mostly when you get into weird situations) Almost every aspect and element of the game is poor, but obfuscated by the sheer magnitude of stuff the game throws at you.\n\nGloomhaven is a great prototype of a much superior game. It is not that game. I'd very much like to play that game, but I have no desire to play more Gloomhaven. I have Jaws of the Lion and a preorder for Frosthaven. Hopefully one or both of those games will build on the promise of Gloomhaven and achieve new heights.",

Whether for good or bad, Gloomhaven has managed to infuse this feature into every single game session by way of the burn mechanic. The only genuine strategic mistake to make in this game is to expend resources on the unnamed hordes of early enemies rather than whatever is waiting at the end of the map. This is not fun for me but judging from the rating people give this game, others disagree.\n\nThe story consists of a faceless narrator giving two sentence explanations as to why you need to slaughter yet another town full of creatures.

    "comment": "I have played this game several times at my friend's place. I very much enjoy RPG/Dungeon Crawler games. However, my problem with Gloomhaven is how it compares to other games in the same genre that I own, notably Descent and Mansions of Madness.\n\nI found Gloomhaven to sort of \"empty\" in terms of what it attempts to be. The game has a beautiful world map and characters with deep skill sets. The game board itself though I find ugly. Everything is all a shade of reddish brown, and each mission map feels the same. Your party is adventuring in a Crypt? Reddish Brown tile. Your party is adventuring in the mountains? Reddish Brown tile. I compare this to Descent which has , in my opinion, beautiful tile work and game boards.\n\nI also find that most of the monsters encountered feel stale. I played about 7 missions in the game (each of which took several hours) and most of what we fought were bandits and skeletons. Now that in of itself is not a problem. However all every monster appears capable off is march forward and draw an attack card. None of them appear to have unique abilities or skills that make them memorable. Further the monsters are represented by carboard cards rather than mini models. This may not be a concern for everyone, but I found it lower quality given the price.\n\nI did find that each story mission takes hours, with very little payoff in the end. Most the of the rewards were pretty bland. Hours of play were rewarded with perks like \"draw one less -1 attack card\", and the items felt mostly the same.\n\nIn the end it maybe I would need to play even more to get to some better unique content, but given I have probably played this for 20 plus hours already I would say there are better options out there.",

So rather than a stealthy dungeon crawl, you have a ‘kick the door down and kill everything as fast as you can’ dungeon crawl. Then you do the exact same thing again, and again, and again…..",

Which will lead to a lot of instant-deaths.\nBe prepared to replay missions, until you have learned what to expect, and can adapt.\n- Combat is very random: You have to play your cards, before you even know the turn-order, and you then draw combat-modifiers for each attack on top.

    "comment": "Was 7.5: Its fun, I don't think its the best board game ever. Its really annoying to set up and takedown, even with the phone apps to reduce components. So getting it to the table has been lacking. It's a good game, there are much better.\n\nNow 5:\nUpdate- After playing this more and more with my girlfriend and gaming group over this pandemic, I can now comfortably say that this game is extremely overrated.\n\nThe mechanics are unique for combat and I do enjoy that but outside of that combat this game is nothing. The amount of set up and tear down to play 2 dungeons and never feel extremely satisfied is not worth it.\n\nFor those touting theme. Guys, seriously go read a book. The writing for this game is garbage and doesn't make sense half the time. It has never drawn any of my gaming group in. We all sit there and read it just waiting to start the dungeon and literally forget all the useless writing we just read. If not for me making up voices and getting into character during those times we'd most likely skim it. I get it to a degree, there is only so much you can put in the book and you don't want to dominate it with the narrative. However, there's no doubt in my mind that the writing could have been so much better. I also realize Im focusing a bit on this but when a game is ranked #1 in multiple categories with one being theme, I'm going to call it out. I may also be bias and expecting great writing because I read great writers like Brandon Sanderson so when I compare his writing to Isaac's its like master class versus a 1st grader.\n\nThere is also a lot of fiddly parts to this game and without the phone app which isn't free, this game would be an unmitigated nightmare to run from an upkeep, set-up, and tear-down standpoint.\n\nBeyond that and again this is just a personal thing. Some of the characters you unlock are really dumb. I get the combos and see the potential in them but half of them leave so much to be desired.\n\nFinal word. My gaming group and I had to homebrew multiple rules to streamline this game and make it more engaging and fun to play. With the homebrew rules I would put this game at a 8 easily. With Isaac's rules, no more than a 5 at best.\n\nMy assessment for JotL is the same as this, except I have to say the demolitionist is really really stupid.\nYes she does the DPS, yea once you hit 5 you get the mech suit, yeah there are probably some combos I didn't see straight off but coming across multiple maps where your kit is all but useless, especially when you take her into original Gloomhaven dungeons, is a joke. The Hatchet is cool, albeit the name is not lmao.",

    "comment": "Gloomhaven is an incredibly ambitious game, and a bit of a beast. It's a legacy RPG dungeon crawl, but it distinguishes itself from other similar campaign or one-off skirmish games with the sheer quantity of content (it has 95 distinct scenarios and roughly 1,700 cards), card driven mechanics, sense of progression, and story elements.\n\nI tend to dislike most combat dice resolution systems, and I much prefer the combat deck system in Gloomhaven. It allows more gradual changes to combat ability, and I like the probability distribution better. The hand management is also an interesting constraint, and serves to drive a lot of the tension in combat.\n\nGloomhaven is a commitment, but it's a good chunk of what I wanted out of RPGs like D&D and more than I expected out of a campaign dungeon crawl.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few areas where I see room for improvement. While the game comes with an incredible amount of content, particularly for it's price point, the component quality is not the best. It's serviceable, particularly if you sleeve the cards, but many similar games have higher quality components. Probably a fourth or less of the actual content, but nicer components. The box really doesn't come with a good method of storing the components, so you'll need to figure out a storage solution.\n\nIn addition, I wish that there were fewer places I had to look to resolve a monster turn. You need to look at the monster action card and compare that against the attack modifier and the monster ability card every time they attack, and if that could have been streamlined down to 2 places to look I feel like the combat would flow more smoothly.\n\nIt's also a long game; a scenario can easily clock in at 2+ hours, and a campaign is ~60 scenarios. In some ways I wish that the combat was faster paced, and more emphasis was placed on the encounter cards and choices outside of combat. I really enjoy the road and city events, and I'd like to see that idea fleshed out more. Sometimes the combat goals don't line up with your character's long term goals or play style, and I would have liked it more if the battle goals were tied into the character's career goals more or at least given more thematic justification.\n\nThere are some other aspects of Gloomhaven that are poorly implemented. The class balance could use some work, many class cards are unnecessarily awkward to use, summons are awkward and often useless, it feels like you should be able to move more freely if you don't do any other actions, and the action economy for some of the long term effects and looting creates awkward situations and tempo problems for certain classes.\n\nStill, Gloomhaven is a big step in the right direction, and there is a lot of fun to be had with it.",

I finally found another game that is similar to Mage Knight after years of failed suggestions from people. I still like MK more, but there's definitely room for this in my collection. I think the people who dislike it wanted it to be more like Descent, but I feel like there's just so many games in that genre (and not to mention, Descent already has so much content and so many versions). I was worried at first about the potential for the card driven attack modifier system, since the thing I loved about MK was the fact that it was more of a deterministic puzzle. I actually might have not backed this game had I watched the videos a bit more closely (I somehow missed that attacks weren't deterministic), but I'm really really glad I did. They end up feeling just fine and adding tension to the game. If all dice games used a system this good, I'd like them a lot more. I'm tempted to use something similar to these cards as a custom variant for Battlelore and other games of mine that I wish I liked more.\n\nUpdate: wow did I change my mind on this one. Extremely repetitive. Great idea and design, poor follow through. Maybe I just don’t like campaign games. But this could have been so much better if you only leveled up faster. As it is it felt just repetitive and boring. It could have been a fantastic non campaign game as a more traditional al one and done coop. Or it could have been a fantastic campaign game with a quicker sense of progression. But it ended up in a weird middle ground and suffered for it. Obviously others disagree. And it’s possible I’ll love the digital version once it’s more fully featured. The core gameplay is really fantastic. It’s Kait the rest that is not so much.",

    "comment": "I've probably played close to 50 games of Gloomhaven. I'm not sure I want to finish the campaign. I haven't had fun in a while. It took me a dozen games to feel comfortable with the rules (and discovering the BGG FAQ thread that really should be in the manual by the fifth print run). I can't honestly say if that investment was worth it.\n\nFor the amount of stuff in this box, there's not a lot of variety. All the missions are either \"kill X monsters\", \"go to place X\", or \"survive X turns\". All the monsters act similarly and you'll have seen them all before playing half the missions. The classes are cool and unique, but you'll likely have to grind missions you've already completed to unlock them. Some nights just feel like a slog to unlock some reward, which makes me question why I'm playing.\n\nThe game is too fiddly. There's so many tokens, but you'll run out of some (or game won't have enough to set up a mission). Enemy management is cumbersome when they reach double-digit counts. Over the course of a night, you'll invariably forget to assign battle goals, or track the elements, or account of the elite monster's shield, or track your experience for a special card, or some other bit of minutia. It's incredibly disheartening to be the one leading the game and to have another player point out a single mistake after several minutes of monster upkeep.\n\nThe combat is tactical, but you're not given many options to create tactics from. Obstacles aren't prominent and don't block ranged attacks, so the only strategic positioning options revolve around doorways. You frequently have turns that just require you to get hit a lot and your only option is to try and split up your group to trick the AI into splitting the damage. You'll also need to chain together action combinations across multiple turns, but an unlucky enemy card draw can cancel everything. The game asks you to meticulously plan, but can easily upset those plans and leave you with no real options.\n\nGloomhaven doesn't deliver a sense of grandeur. The main plot tangents away very quickly and you're left with random threads you'll forget how you started. You're given random events, but most of them amount to \"do an interesting thing\" or \"ignore it\". Even if there is a choice, you'll typically follow your party's alignment, which removes the actual \"choice\" part. All the text does build an interesting world, but I'm left wishing I could instead play a real RPG in that world.\n\nThere are little things too: typos, rule ambiguities, a lack of token baggies, a nonsensical box inlay, poorly balanced scenarios, arbitrary item pricing, the too-small-for-damage-tokens monster card sleeves, and a lack of player quick reference sheets. There's some fun moments to be had and a ton of content. I get why this game exists and why some people would love it. I don't really understand why it's #1.",

Its hard to give this game a bad review because I spend a lot of money on it, and spent hours painting the minis. But in the end, I don't actually like the whole \"cards replacing dice\" mechanic of this game. Basically, imagine playing Dungeons and Dragons with a Doomtracker that every round you spend in the dungeon brings you closer to failure. You have no time to loot bodies or look for treasure; you barely have time to fight the enemies and complete the main goal and you end up leaving a lot behind and get very frustrated that you have all these options but can't use them because you are too worried that you will run out of cards before you win. I would call this genre of game, strict card rationing game. It reminds me a lot of 7th continent which I also don't own and didn't like.",

Having to play a fantasy dungeon crawler as a campaign/legacy over the course of dozens of plays is absolute torture that I’m only doing because I like my friends and they love the game.\n\nI’ve also become aware that a giant box full of stuff to sort, keep track of, set up, tear apart, recatalogue, and rebox is all kinds of joy sucking annoyance. I can maybe do that for a game I’m enthusiastic about; for a game I would ditch in a hot second to play anything else? Not so much.\n\nDespite the game being a depressingly unfun — one might say “gloomy” — experience for me, I acknowledge the cleverness of the 2 card, top-bottom action combination mechanism.\n\nI also acknowledge that there are great moments for the game group when, after convincing yourselves that you’ll lose the scenario, you end up pulling it out of the fire with an incredible awesome draw of the modifier deck. Yay!\n\nApparently, 33K+ people (including my game group) think this game is a tremendous achievement in modern board gaming, so maybe believe them instead of me.\n\nI’m not having fun, 21 games in, and I doubt that will change in the next 21+ games to come. If I never have to play another fantasy dungeon crawler campaign game again, I wouldn’t miss that even a tiny bit.",

    "comment": "Would be a good game if playtime was halved. The main problem with the game is that it tries to be both a lite RPG, in a more accessible Board Game format and fails at both.\n\nFor example the playtime for the game I feel is too high for what I felt is an RPG on rails format, missions on average took us 3 hours playtime (not including setup) with occasional replays of failed missions required. Doing this once a week it took us over a year to complete the main story missions alone (there were still loads of non story missions left).\n\nThe investment of time would be fine if the RPG elements were more rewarding, but unfortunately the game restricts your character development and player choice immensely.\n\nThe game tells you when you have to stop playing as a character, the gold you collect becomes useless essentially once your character dies (you can upgrade cards with it but this is restricted greatly), you can only choose from a tiny list of levelling bonuses.\n\nIn addition to this the pace at which some characters, weapons and items unlock is glacial. You can easily pour 36 hours into the game and maybe only have a third of the items and weapons unlocked to purchase. And because these items don't carry over to the new character every time you are forced to pick a new character, you start on a low level with virtually no items. This means you can easily spend most of the next few missions grinding for items purely to be some help to your group.\n\nIn summary although in many ways an enjoyable game. I feel Gloomhaven was simply too repetitive and restrictive an experience for me as a player, to recommend anyone else investing the time required to play it fully.",

This game just doesn't do a great job at tracking how you have done anything, yes you may have unlocked achievements...but how did it happen, was it a card, quest, flavor text somewhere...who knows. Those fun dungeons, which ones did we do? Which ones are we on? Again, without a separate additional log, its super hard to keep track of.\nThe dungeons are another area I struggle to enjoy. When we first started off (in a 2 player campaign) we lost over and over again, and it wasn't that we were getting killed just losing our cards in one off attacks, we were just exhausting from lack of cards. After losing in the same dungeon (second one IIRC) we broke our \"we must complete each dungeon 100% fairly\" rule and fudged around a tiny bit. Did we win, sure, even on normal it was easy to beat the AI, did it feel good purely attacking the enemies, never looting the treasure and only situational getting the \"gold\" tokens while cheating a tiny bit not to exhaust? Absolutely not. We didn't feel like adventures, we felt like weaklings with no strategy. We even made it a point to play as hard core strategically as we could thinking out every move and turn to maximize every drop of out abilities and we still barely managed to squeeze by. (FYI we were playing the rouge and the mindthief). This all changed when we added a 3rd teammate (the brute) where the difficulty flipped to, too easy. We could position the brute to take the hits, move around the dungeon to key areas and land great hits while collecting the bonuses (other than treasure of course, because that is always impossible). Now the game is played either with a difficulty drop of 1 or 2 in 2 player and a difficulty increase of 2 or 3 in 3 or 4 player. The balance is really strange and I feel it also has to do with the chosen characters, but why would A game handicap you for choosing characters you know nothing about and can't possibly know they don't work well together....\nSure, I do enjoy getting this game on the table, building the narrative of these regular adventures going on these little missions and making decisions as they do, but it has always felt a little detached unlike many other campaign games I own or have played.\nI agree this game is great and has so much going for it, but it feels really rough around the edges and shallow in content.\nAlso, as a huge model hobbyist, I dislike that not only are all the regular infantry card board cut outs, but so are the unique bosses, I feel that this was a bit of a missed opportunity (add on or expansion pack?) and don't get me started on the quality of the hero miniatures, these days I feel like a bottom tier 3D printer could produce better results with free STL files you could find online.\nWhile I was super excited when the we got the game and watched to rush into it and play as much as possible (thinking it would be a less heavy version of KD)...it has just died after about 20 missions and no one really volunteers it as an option to play during game night anymore.",

You waste so much time doing that that your scenario takes from 5 to 15 minutes longer (depending on the size of the scenario).\nReplacing the eight monster cards with a table you roll onto would have maybe removed the surprise of what is behind he next card, but it would have removed lots of useless procedures.\n\nI have nothing against heavy games but as long as they use mechanics and not procedures. Because when to do procedures, you are not playing, as for mechanics, you do things because of an action you did. For example, Agricola is a heavy medium game that has mechanics and just two small procedures each turn (turning turn card and adding things to the board) which does not bog game play much. In Gloomhaven, you shuffle your deck, you shuffle the monster's deck, the other players shuffle their decks, you must draw a monster card for each monster type, you must draw and attack card for each monster miniature, you must draw a card for each attack card of your character, the other players do the same, etc.\n\nThis card system belongs to another age, the 1980s.\n\nI am certain that we can figure out a much more efficient way to play Gloomhaven that would reduce the time scenarios take to finish by a good 20%. Not to mention diminishing the box's content and weight (thus reducing its cost so it will sell more).\n\nOur group of game designers and our coaches hates procedures. There are too many small rules too.\n\nUnless streamlined, like Arkham Horror this game would be best as a video game than a board game right now.\n\nWithout the heavy procedures and small rules, this game is a 9/10.",

Setup is also very long, but for people people who want to play an RPG game solo this gets a 10 in my books. It felt like reading a good book.",

The setup takes longer than the game play... too many pieces distract from the enjoyment of the game. The element board is annoying and doesn't add much to the game.

It has completely replaced Descent, for us though.\n\nThe first scenario seemed brutally hard for my wife and I. We are definitely going to be playing on easy. If I'm going to be committing 2 hours to setup, play, and tear down a game, I don't want to feel bruised when I'm done.\n\nSo far my only real complaint is that some of the components are pretty lame. The cards, specifically...they just feel cheap. Having said that, you get a ton for your money here. I don't get hung up too much on components or theme.

The apparent epic volume of content in original Gloomhaven wasn't served by comparably epic writing as one would expect from such a long-running number one spot. JoTL had a more appropriate scale to the writing, I feel. Unlocking characters keeps this semi-engaging, but things don't develop as much as I would want or expect. I was expecting more from the writing, or perhaps less, so as to leave room for more imagination. The mechanics are a finely tuned machine, of course. To be fair, I am keen to play at least one session of Frosthaven to see what parts of the beast Isaac has sanded down, and which he's polished up.",

The combat system is excellent, but games like Pillars of Eternity, Baldur's Gate 3, or even DND give me everything I like about Gloomhaven’s campaign (including co-op in some cases) but with better story and characters, less bookkeeping, and WAY shorter setup time. Sure you’re getting your moneys worth with this game, but Gloomhaven has taught me that there is such a thing as “too much.” I can play on the far better Steam digital version as well, but that is still not as good as the aforementioned video games or any intense strategy games such as XCom.\n\nThis game is overrated from selection bias IMO and while it’s a good campaign game, I think there’s really so much better out there that’s far less annoying to actually play. And as a side, if you’re rating this game really high purely for the videogame adaptation, then you’re not rating the board game. You’re rating the Videogame.",

    "comment": "You like dungeon crawls? You like tactical combat with tough choices every turn? You like a massive world where your decisions actually shape the story? Here it is, Gloomhaven which is KIND OF A LOT OF BRAIN POWER THINKING XD! A 1–4 player cooperative campaign game where you and your party of adventurers dive into dangerous dungeons, forgotten ruins, and branching storylines that change every time you play.\n\nHow do you win? By working together to survive the scenario in front of you slaying monsters, grabbing loot, and making choices that ripple across an ever changing world. But don’t get too comfortable… every decision changes what comes next, and like a giant “Choose Your Own Adventure,” your story can twist in ways you never expect.\n\nThe core of the game is its brilliant card-based combat system. Each round, you’ll pick two cards from your hand, using the initiative number to see when you act. Each card has a top and bottom ability attack, move, heal, or something crazy powerful and you’ll play one top and one bottom every turn. Sounds simple, right? NOPE, until you realize cards are your lifeline. Use them too recklessly, and you’ll burn through your deck and exhaust yourself before the dungeon is done.As you play, your characters grow stronger, unlocking new abilities, gear, and even whole new adventurers to swap in. But the world of Gloomhaven changes too—scenarios unlock, cities evolve, and your party’s reputation can shape the fate of the land.\n\nIt’s tactical, it’s massive, and no two campaigns will ever be the same. Will your adventurers carve out their legend… or be swallowed by the darkness of Gloomhaven? XD",

There is so much to keep track of and fiddle with. The game has solo scenarios, which are designed to be played by just one person, and I've only played ~3 of the at least 8 characters that I could have done the solo scenario for; because playing this game solo felt like a chore. I'd never play this game with only two people, and I'd never play it if I had to set it up and put it away every session. I'd like this more as a video game than I do as a board game.",

Thus severely limiting your number of turns.\nSo yeah, you're basicly punished for doing cool powerful things. It's not a bad game, but this fact, compared with the not very original and slow gameplay makes me rate it a 6.\nIt is a more \"euro\" and varied interpration of a typical dungeon crawler.\n\nBut in reality, when ranking this game on bgg, we should be rating this game a 1.

Make no mistake, this is a Euro puzzle in the drapings of a dungeon crawler, which is fine, but this has very little to do with a traditional Ameritrash dungeon crawler in the veins of Warhammer Quest, with all the good and bad that comes with it. For me, the latter feels like an adventure, with emotional highs and lows. This feels like a Euro puzzle. So, if you are looking for a Euro puzzle with a fantasy setting this might be a great pick.

Was rating it as high as a 9 but it's become a bit samey/slow for me, and the story isn't elevating the game beyond its (very good) core mechanics. A very good game but not a game I love.\n\n*****\n\nEdit 1-24-2022: Dropping to a 7. I think my biggest issue is that limited information coordinating with 3 other people feels like work. I might like it better with 2 or 3 than with 4.\n\nThe game’s also too slow (both the scenarios and character progression), not very interesting story, many arbitrary rules (summon movement, when you can use items and dismiss cards, etc), combat mechanics allow cool small-combos but feeling a bit rote at this point. Still, a good game and it's fun to learn how to play a new character. And I still feel like there might be more depth to the card play yet to discover. But the magic is gone.\n\n**********\n\nEdit 11-21-2024: dropping to a 6. I just don’t want to play this game anymore. I had a very good time with it, but it now just feels like a euro optimization puzzle with more bells and whistles.",

They haven't. I'm still having fun with great friends, but each scenario appears to be just a variant of \"kill all of the monsters in this dungeon\" every time. The minor flavor text at the beginning of each one are simply to figure out which fork of the path you choose, but then you just end up in a room killing all the monsters again.

Gloomhaven is a puzzle game first and foremost with more akin to Spirit Island (and I love Spirit Island!) than Imperial Assault. In the end it is a move through rooms with maximum efficiency while managing your fatigue until you finish a scenario, mostly by killing all enemies or killing a boss. The gameplay loop is fine and the character development is fun but somehow it always turns into a numbercruncher and some cards and classes are just way more tuned than others.\n\nThe semi-cooperative take on the dungeons and the looting locked after completing an objective felt weird for an old roleplayer such as myself but fine, it is intended. It ended up with grind, and I hate arbitrary grind..\n\nThe setup and teardown is horrendous, the bookkeeping quite tedious and the story is passable.\n\nIn the end Gloomhaven is a fine game. If you expect awesome roleplaying exercises look elsewhere. The setup is the main flaw and I know there are expensive organisers but I don't want to spend more on an already prizy product. This is a fine enough tactical puzzle with fantasy trappings.",

    "comment": "This is a dungeon crawl game with a sprawling ongoing campaign and certain legacy mechanisms where you alter the map, and your characters across multiple plays. The game is completely diceless, so it relies on a flip-luck card driven combat modifiers, which are a little more interesting as over time you can customize the contents of the various combat decks to a certain extent.\n\nThe writing is well enough for a game like this. Not terrible, but not very compelling. The components are rough, as rather than this being a game with tons of nice minis, everything outside of player characters are standees which can be hard to see or differentiate from each other. Health and monster stats are also tracked off on the side of the board, which means it can get confusing as to which monster does what and who has however much life left.\n\nMechanically players are fueled by ability cards, where you choose two cards from your array, then use the top half of one and the bottom half of the other. At times this can be an interesting puzzle, but over the course of the game you wind up losing cards from your array, and when the players lose a map, it's more often to players falling over due to not having enough cards left to finish than it is to actually getting trounced in an interesting tactical puzzle. I find this to be somewhat disappointing when it happens.\n\nDowntime between turns is also quite long not only because of the awkward bookkeeping but also because as players chose their cards for the next round. They aren't allowed to talk about what they plan to do specifically, so turn order flies a little blindly with players stumbling over each other at times.",

Sure the enemies change each time, but you are basically doing the same thing, with the same cards, for between 50 and 100 sessions. It feels way too procedural after about 10-15 sessions, and at that point you still have 100 hours left.\n3. Setup, tear down, and management of the system are a huge burden. We played right after receiving the original Kickstarter before the management apps became a thing, and managing all the moving parts was more work than it was worth.

It seems to take the concept of a D&D 4th edition session, deconstructs it down to micro-events spread across dual purpose cards, then re-assembles it into something where you spend every initiative round frowning at cards, deciding which to chain together, which will be ok to discard for the next X rounds, which will be good to burn for the rest of the scenario at certain points, table-talk about who moves where, who can infuse the battlefield with an element that someone else can use with their card, etc, etc... all for a single round in a skirmish with a handful of bandit fodder.\n\nIt sounds interesting on paper but it can be taxing, especially if taken as an experience of playing a board game emulating an RPG-in-a-box. Looking at it from that angle, I feel like the freedom and playfulness, and straight up velocity of the genre is pared down to cardplay that feels oddly restrictive, fussy, and slow despite the agency that it provides in the game (and those cards do allow you to do some really cool stuff). It's like you have to squeeze through this gauntlet of boardgamey analysis, just to pull something off that would have taken quick clearance from a DM and the roll of a d20.\n\nBut I think I have to resist looking at it from that angle because I suspect that the smaller narratives being churned through game mechanics is exactly what a board gamer coming at this genre from their own angle may expect. Case in point, there are tons of Mage Knight fans. I'm not one of those fans, for somewhat similar reasons as I'm conflicted about this game. This takes Mage Knight's crunchiness of systems propelling simple diegetic events and extends it, almost obscenely, across potentially years worth of play.\n\nIt's kind of a baffling game for me, at this point. It's something to be marveled at, but it's also a commitment that I'm not sure I'm going to find anywhere outside of solo play. My game group is most definitely not ready for this, and my son, who normally eats up this style of card play, is turned off by endlessly shuffled, swingy modifier cards (effectively a mutable d20, disguised to assuage die aversion) that can easily tank an hours-long scenario. So yeah, there it is on my table: a sea of solo campaign play, but also a brain burn. I'm not sure how often I want those two aspects joined together.\n\nEdit: I don't need those aspects joined together, like ever. When I'm in the mood to play Brass Birmingham, I play that. When I want a satisfying dungeon crawl or adventure system, I play anything *other* than this. Donated to a curious friend, with zero regrets. This game simply isn't for me.",

A friend assisted me and did the teach, for which I am grateful for because I understand the rulebook is a small disaster.\n\nI really enjoyed the choices you have to make in the card combination each round. And the solo campaign was challenging and exciting until the end.\n\nSo I tagged along with a group that already had played more than 60 times. The benefit is that your character already starts at a high level, giving you better cards to play with. The downside is that you don't have any knowledge about the world and the thrill of exploration is missing.\n\nAfter a few more plays I do feel that the game is somewhat repetitive, I am doing basically the same thing every scenario. There is definitely more to explore when you play with different characters, but it takes a decent amount of games before you reach your character's retirement.",

    "comment": "Popular BGG number 1 rank Euro dungeon crawl legacy game by Isaac Childres. Very puzzly hand management: choose two cards and use the upper part of one card and the lower part of the other card. One of these cards also determines your initative for a round.\nGloomhaven has two layers of gameplay: tactical combat and questing on a world map with trading for equipment and dealing with random (binary choice) events.\n\nI like:\n+ Great app on Steam that takes care of the annoying set-up, tear-down, rules, and bookkeeping\n+ Massive amount of content (to unlock) and play time for hundreds of hours\n+ Great tactical combat hand management system (card driven, a lot of decision making: discard the card for the rest of the combat, pick one of the different action on the card, modifier cards add uncertainty). Your remaining cards also act as an additional life meter for your hero (no more cards, hero gets exhauted)\n+ There are also strategic aspects which cards to burn (unavailable for the rest of the encounter)\n+ Monster combat AI is quick but sometimes stupid and unthematically. However, monster movement is complex and error-prone (not deal breaking)\n+ A lot of different characters and monsters to unlock who play very differently (some may be better or more fun than others)\n+ Unusual retire mechanic where your hero disappears and you choose a new, different character (variety). This also mitigates problems that normally occur when playing with (overpowered) maximally leveled heroes\n+ Equipment and perks provide additional boosts\n+ Difficulty adjusts well with different players and levels\n+ Artwork\n\nNeutrals:\n# Mostly deterministic, however, some luck of the draw (resolving combat modifiers)\n# Life goals are neat and fun in the beginning\n# Mixed components, overall good production\n# Player count: 3-4 players complement each other better than 2 players. 3-4 player will unlock more envelopes but takes longer to complete a mission. 2 player is more difficult\n# Solo: play two heroes\n# Simple multiple choice quests that may change the story of the game\n# Drawn battle goals may be hard to achieve with certain characters\n# Players' summons are controlled by AI who act quite stupid and inefficient\n# Elements add another layer but also more bookkeeping\n# Big game box (which is necessary for its content)\n# Table hog\n# Kill all monsters as usual win condition\n# Story is okay at best. Focus is on the puzzly combat\n# Combat system is good but can also be frustrating when you have to waste actions\n# Restricted communication: initiative values.\n\nI do not like:\n- Some scenarios are hard to win (requires very optimized play or certain abilities) and may stop you from progressing the campaign.\n- Repetitive, slow grinding is a big aspect of the game's progression\n- Very stupid monster scripts.\n- Long setup / teardown (longer than an actual game)\n- Big rules book and the rulebook has several ambiguities. Hard to learn\n- A custom storage solution improves usability a lot\n- Random events between encounters where you choose one of two options which provide negative effects\n- There are some semi-coop elements (personal combat objectives, life objectives, looting, no equipment sharing). Thematically, all players are selfish rogues. This feels a bit odd at times, because overall the game appears more like a fully cooperative dungeon crawler.\n- As you lose cards over the course of the battle, your options diminish over time.\n\nSimilar games:\n* Sword & Sorcery\n* Dungeon Alliance (very deterministic dungeon crawler and deck building, scenario-based, story expansions available)\n* Middara (fully cooperative JRPG inspired miniatures adventure, dungeon crawl, campaign game, simple dice-based combat, weak story)\n* Too Many Bones (dice-based skirmish game, more randomness, less deterministic, no big campaign, less time consuming)",

Apart from that I think it's intriguing, A classical, or a version of a classical setting.\n\nOn a second tought, it feels like we are playing a four people solitaire game.\nMan! It seriously lack interactions between characters, all we can do is steal from each others and compete to gain more gold and experience.. The game tells you the characters are a mercenary group, but they have totally no coordination or even the need to cooperate. They seems more a gang of thugs and bandits. Plus the \"roleplay feel rules\" make coordination impossibile. And when a character became retired it leave a small poor bonus (taking away treasures and gold..). So in my opinion this is a solitaire game, that you can play with up to four friends, but made no difference if you were alone.\nAh there is also another mistery, at the end of a quest you cannot retrieve the unlooted money from the floor. Even if you have defeated everything and there is a lot of time. Why? I think it's made to empower the competition between players. And so it give a feeling of a game for people who play whitout cooperating at all, for people who are basically closed in themselves but also with a bad temper.\n\nWell I still think it's enjoyable, a good game, but need some home rules.",

Once I'm done with the play, nothing lasts for me. Empty. The game mechanics are about as good as one would expect from DnD kind of game, but for a game ranked this high, I'd still expect some niche which is not there. Storywise, it's not interesting at all, just basic as hell. I also couldn't deal with the setup where you cannot continue with your chosen character for whole game but you should give it away after completing his mission and take another one to start over - not a fan! When I do role play, I commit and I want my character to go full path!  Overall, this is average, really. This game is best at nothing, it's just biggest and to be fair, it does nothing significantly wrong, so I guess that's why it's popular.

Seems to be a D&D campaign ran through a boardgame with the DM being the game itself. Sounds amazing but will require the right group of players who can do so regularly. I hope to get a group so this doesn't sit dauntingly for too long. Feel free to squeeze into my group for it by force \n\nMy verdict: I love this as a solo game. I am using 3 characters for my party. It takes me like 4 hours to setup, slog through a scenario, cleanup, etc. But I have enjoyed doing this on boring days when others couldn't come. My first mission played with other players and a couple times I have had people play as part of my party during my main solo campaign. Those experiences have been alright and everyone sort of liked it but were not sold on it. It took long enough to teach them and there was too much confusion to play combat with hidden card selection so I just am not seeing the ideal situation for multiplayer in it. But for solo, this satisfies a short term game solution for me. I will probably burn through enough of it that things start to get repetitive soon. But so far unlocking new characters (retired 4 of them in my first week of play after about 20 scenarios completed) has kept me interested for now. I am trying to keep the copy in good shape and will likely trade it when I am finished milking what there is for me to enjoy from it.",

You could strip away the scenario book from this game and the mechanics alone would make it a keeper for me.\n+ Having all your cards in hand at the beginning of the game and choosing two cards every turn is fun and creates awesome combos.\n+ The attack modifier deck is great. The fact that you can upgrade it to mitigate the risks is awesome.\n+ Leveling up is very satisfying. So many great choices when building your characters deck.\n+ Each characters feel extremely different.\n+ So. Much. Content.\n\nWhat I dislike:\n- Why do designers keep putting random results that cancel your attacks? Null results can be really frustrating.\n- Terribly time-consuming to set up. I've had to resort to using apps to help me track things during a game and help ease setup time.\n- The scenarios are not very well balanced. Some are easy, some are hard, you never know what you're getting into.\n\nWhy I got rid of it:\nAfter 20 or so scenarios, I felt the game was getting repetitive and grindy. Also, it was difficult for me to put a group together to continue with the campaign, and I tried playing solo and did not enjoy managing two hands of cards. I had a lot of fun with it, but it was gathering dust.",

Rather than making choices to create an interesting story, it feels more like you are constantly struggling against the game.

I have a theory as to why it has such a high rating: given its huge price point and time requirement, I assume that most of the people rating are people who bought it after researching it thoroughly in order to ensure that they would enjoy it. This certainly is not an impulse buy game.\n\nPositives:\n* The action system is fairly clean; I like that all actions are card-driven, each card has default modes, and your deck acts as a timer of sorts.\n* Lots of variety between classes.\n\nNeutral\n* Retiring heroes is thematically a bit strange, but I can see how it does guarantee you'll get to experience a variety of heroes.\n\nNegatives:\n* Tedium to the max. Repetitive quests. Yet for those who want a crunchy, heavy dungeon crawler that takes literally months to complete... this is it. In that sense, it is quite an impressive accomplishment.\n\nIf you want the gameplay stripped of all of the tedium, check out the digital version. I still find it too tedious even in this medium. So many better digital dungeon crawlers out there (Darkest Dungeon being the best, hands down), but I can see this being fun if you have friends you want to play with.",

    "comment": "TL;DR: Amazing design, progression and story but just not that fun to actually play solo and not practical for most people's lives.\n\nSo hard to score this game.\n\nMechanically and thematically the game is fantastic. Hell, I even loved the flavour text, leveling mechanics, branching story paths and how events can lead to good or bad consequences later in the game!\n\nBut here's the problem: The mechanics don't suit the length of the campaign.\n\nI love long, thinky, heavy, puzzly games like Mage Knight, the Mistfall series and even Unicornus Knights.\nBut you sit down for a few hours and play them ONCE! Then you're free to pack them up or reset, change characters/scenarios and play again.\n\nMage Knight is my favourite game but I wouldn't want to have to play it 75+ times to complete a campaign and Gloomhaven, after about a dozen plays, starts to feel more like an obligation-or even another job rather than some fun for a few hours.\n\nBut I LOVE CAMPAIGNS!! It's just that I think I prefer campaigns for games that are lighter. Games like WarhammerQuest ACG, Descent 2nd Ed, Pathfinder ACG, Sword & Sorcery etc where combat can be streamlined with a quick dice-chuck and some clever card play to mitigate the risk of poor luck\n\nI think I'd prefer this game to either be a dice chucker and keep the campaign\nOR\nKeep it the way it is but have the Set up, tear down, leveling and axe the campaign, instead making it scenario-based.\n\n\nPOSITIVES\n+Brilliant tactical combat\n+I'm really enjoying the story so far\n+Character boxes/envelopes are great for storing active/locked/retired heroes\n+Satisfying leveling system\n+Shop/prosperity system\n+Variety in Characters\n+Battle and life goals really impact how you play and decisions you make not only in the scenario but during road and city events or even how you spend your money\n+Removing/adding heroes to the party is pretty easy\n+Gameplay is pretty intuitive once you've got the hang of it\n+Lots of 'Kill Everything' scenarios which I love\n\n\nNEGATIVES\n-Game is too heavy for a campaign so long/Campaign is too long for a game so heavy\n-Scenarios take too long to have a group of adults be able to commmit to the campaign. And if they do, they're likely going to want to play an RPG instead.\n-Solo experience is great but takes away from playing other games\n-Box insert is great for shipping but absolutely useless for keeping a campaign organised (except for character boxes-they're great!)\n-Had to spend a small fortune on various folders organisers to be able top keep track of my campaign\n\nWORTH NOTING:\nI have a games room with a table and storage dedicated to Gloomhaven including folders, boxes and even a craft table that fits underneath so it keeps everything organised.\nI even have a magnetic whiteboard with magnetised map stickers. map and an A3 sized party sheet to record where I'm at.\nNow I understand that not many people have this luxury but let me put it this way: If I didn't, I WOULD NOT KEEP IT. Seriously, you're not going to get you money's worth if, over the course of a campaign, you don't want to spend DOZENS of hours setting up and re-organising.\nThis game needs its OWN TABLE and storage system.\n\nI normally find setting up a board game oddly relaxing. Not Gloomhaven. I dread the set up-even with all the organisational luxuries that I have and have mentioned.\n\nWhen I do play I have a GREAT time!!!\nBut when it's over and I realise how much work is now ahead of me. It's worth it at the moment in my opinion however I can completely understand anyone who abandons this game after a few sessions.",

    "comment": "The amount of grind that feels non-sense is somehow too frustrating with this game... Mechanics are easily broken by exploiting possibility for endless retries for scenarios for hoarding xp and coins...\n\nAll seems futile though as the combat is a let down with the way the cards are consumed for resting. Most of the scenarios are \"Kill All\" type which makes most of the characters non-desirable to play with as on couple are oriented to high damage per action and can deliver enough movement and hits.\n\nThe \"story\" is layered but feels very thin as you can lose as may times as you want and only a couple of times some scenarios close some others when successful. There's absolutely no penalty ever for losing which makes the story plot feel very hollow.\n\nWouldn't recommend this to anyone wishing to play adventure game or anyone wishing to see some evolving story .... This goes if you like to choose from large number of random fights and try to overcome those with different characters that can be chosen with several builds. Though as a fighting game the loss of cards by resting makes it somehow lacking the quick card loss kind of a makes it very straightforward that you cannot build combos but need to just choose high damage and high move cards and maybe permanent buffs.\n\nWith more flexible resting that allows recovering cards without loss, this game gets much better (I'd give 7 or 8) as the fighting gets way lore interesting and even single character can generate nice combos. The more epic feeling makes the battles feel non-grind and there's actually some chance the story progresses fast enough to retain some interest.\n\nThe game components are terrible to organize and some gametray or small container boxes are an absolute necessity. This is quite sad quality for a game of this high price point. Also finding correct pieces for each scenario gets very frustrating quickly and you'll curse the double-sided small terrain pieces... The component quality feels very cheap in many occasions. Also it is a travesty that they don't include the removable stickers set as a default but it needs to be bought separately.\n\nCompanion app is nice, but it is an absolute shame that the short story audio pieces are a separate buy for a game that has made this much money... Some such story audio should be already included as you buy the game as there's hardly enough components to justify the otherwise high cost.",

There, it often feels like you fight against a Dungeon Master.\n\nThe encounters between the missions belong to the worst game mechanics I know. Such a random thing.

This system only works well as a video game, and in the world of video games, it has stiff competition.\n\nHaving said that, learning the adventurers and working out team compositions is quite fun. The Rest system also makes for tight games, which I appreciate.\n\nThings I love: (The Card System!)\n- A fresh take on multi-use cards: select two, then use the top action of one and the bottom action of the other. Also, a card sets your starting order, which adds to the complexity and decision-ing.\n- Rest system: Take a full turn of inaction to take a better version of a card refresh action? Or take the instantaneous one that adds penalty of luck of the draw?\n- This decision is also important for tempo/longevity, as taking Short Rests leads to more quickly running out of cards and becoming Exhausted.\n- (Not part of the cards) Traps combined with push/pull effects make for some clever turns and fun postioning\n\nThings I dislike: (Everything else)\n- There are just too many things to maintain and manage in a scenario. It isn't complicated, but does feel like a chore and takes me away from the fun of playing the cards.\n- Combat resolution via the combat cards is clever, since they may be upgraded, but slows the game down (and again feels like a chore).\n- The dungeon crawling aspect just feels lacking somehow. Maybe it is the slow chore (3rd mention) of collecting money and loot, or maybe it is that your character isn't able to upgrade (level ups or gear) mid-scenario, so working through the scenario just feels like a ...chore. I'd rather Diablo's approach of rewards *during* the combat, or Final Fantasy's shorter combats with rewards given inbetween.\n\nIt is a game I hope other games will draw insiration from, but not one I recommend.",

    "comment": "Gloomhaven – A Heavyweight Classic That Shows Its Age\nRating: 7/10\n\nThere’s no denying that Gloomhaven is a landmark title in modern board gaming—ambitious, expansive, and offering hundreds of hours of content. Its tactical combat system and legacy campaign structure were groundbreaking at launch, and it’s easy to see how it captured the hearts of many.\n\nThat said, playing Gloomhaven in 2025 feels like wrestling with an outdated system. Setup and teardown are a chore, made worse by the complete absence of an insert or organizational logic. For a game that costs over €170, the user experience is surprisingly poor unless you're willing to invest in a third-party storage solution.\n\nComponent-wise, the disparity between expectations and reality is stark. A few unpainted miniatures, a sea of cardboard standees—even bosses feel underwhelming on the table. And despite the deep mechanics, the rules often feel more convoluted than clever. Even after multiple sessions, we kept stumbling over interpretations and edge cases.\n\nWhen compared to something like Arydia, which offers painted minis, streamlined gameplay, and a beautifully engineered box—all at a similar price point—Gloomhaven starts to feel clunky and dated. Arydia simply delivers a smoother, more elegant experience straight out of the box.\n\nIn the end, Gloomhaven remains a notable and sometimes thrilling ride, but one that requires a lot of patience, housekeeping, and tolerance for rough edges. For some, it’s a masterpiece. For others, like me, it’s a good game trapped in a frustrating package.",

Without equipment, deep knowledge of characters or enemies, limited options\n\n2/3 (20-40 scenarios) This is where Gloomhaven works best. The so called \"midgame\" was the most fun for us, as we already had a more varied selection of items, interesting characters and the story still made sense\n+ This is the third we think the game benefits the most from, a sufficiently frequent supply of \"new\"\n- There's nothing I would mention\n\n3/3 (10-20 scenarios) At this point, the campaign is almost free-falling into frustration and we found it hard to finish.

Rest, short rest you put a random discarded card in the lost pile, long rest you chose.\nSo basically every cycle you end up with less options until you \"fatigue\" and at that point it's game over.\n\nSome people may love this mechanic, I personally do not.\nA lot of pick your own adventure game are either story or combat focused, and with how gloomhaven is set up you'll do a lot of combat, which I'm all for but I don't feel like it works as well as I'd like.\n\nOf course this is subjective, if this mechanic doesn't matter at all to you, or you like such a mechanic, this game is an easy 9-10 in it's category.",

Leider ist der Aufwand für das doch recht einfache Gameplay viel zu hoch. Bis ein Spielfeld aufgebaut und vorbereitet ist, dauert es einfach zu lange. Die Szenarios sind dann auch erst im Midgame wirklich toll; zu Beginn frustriert das Spiel, bis man sich eingespielt hat. Oft spielt man auch nur 30 bis 45 Minuten an einem Szenario, das man aber fast die selbe Zeit aufgebaut hat... nur um dann nicht selten zu versagen und zurückgeworfen zu werden.\n\n95% der Spieler werden das Game wohl niemals durchspielen, es ist schlichtweg zu viel und zu repetitiv. In dem Moment, wo alle oder fast alle Charaktere freigeschaltet sind, verliert es dann auch schnell seinen Reiz, denn die Story, die das Gameplay aufwiegen könnte, ist sehr unspektakulär. Dies fällt vor allem auf, wenn man die (sehr werktreue) Software-Variante auf PC spielt, bei der die Hauptkritikpunkte, die Aufbauzeit und Verwaltung, entfallen. Gloomhaven ist ein gutes Spiel, wird dem Hype aber kaum gerecht.\n\nIch nutze die Inhalte der Box mittlerweile als Ideensteinbruch und die Miniaturen für andere Figurenspiele oder für's Rollenspiel und bin recht zufrieden damit.",

The game at its best is when you use a completely overpowered and unfair ability to clear a room of enemies or stun multiple enemies to make their turns useless. However this is not good game design.\n\nFurthermore, the brokenness becomes unfun. The personal quest design is horrible. I have had players not be able to retire because we don’t want to replay scenarios to kill specific enemies needed for the quest. We haven’t even be able to retire one character who needs a specific scenario appear whereas another player has retired twice in 20 scenarios.\n\nThe scenarios range from trivial to nearly impossible with 4 players without using specific stun heavy/insta kill builds. It is incredibly tedious to replay a scenario you have sunk 2 hours into. The second scenario in the game seems to be one of the hardest for no apparent reason, how did that get past playtesting? There are definitely fun scenarios though.\n\nThe story is not interesting. There are no chat after motivations or nuanced plot points. You lose track of what’s happening very quickly with the story.\n\nSome cards are utterly useless and some are must-picks, forcing you into certain play patterns across scenarios.\n\nWe have been using the house rule within digital to remove the x2s and misses. A lot of the time when you get a x2 it is wasted. However each time you draw a miss and you waste a whole planned out turn involving other characters it feels so incredibly bad.\n\nI'd rate the physical version lower than the digital as I cannot imagine how tiresome it would be to do the monster turns, especially with 4 players where sometimes there are 10+ enemies acting each round. Well I can actually because I’ve played Jaws of the Lion with 2 players and that was enough.\n\nStill a 7 because the card play and systems are great and fun with friends but the game is just too big in every way, causing it to be quantity over quality.",

    "comment": "Finally got on the Gloomhaven bandwagon. I never in a million years thought my partner would want to try this game. Not only did she try it but she immediately fell in love with it. My play count is a bit off (meaning we have more plays than currently recorded) but basically once we started we stopped playing all other board games for basically three months. Using an app to help with all the bookkeeping and round management is an absolute must. With all that said though I did find myself growing tired of all the setup steps. I eventually got an organizer as well which greatly improves the setup and cleanup but I still found myself thinking really this would benefit from being a video game more than a board game. Now that said if it were a video game my partner would've never joined me in that experience so I think in the end I am still glad it exists in cardboard. We haven't completed all the campaign content yet. In the end the game is perfect for what it is and I can see why it is rated the number one game. I keeping just shy of 10 because I think once I have completed it once it will likely leave my collection (I got all the reusable stickers and did everything I could to keep the game in a way that it can be fully reset). Everyone should try this game at least once. But I think the experience really starts to improve after a few storylines get opened up.",

I like being able to build your deck how you like depending on your preferred play-style and I like all the mercenary options, but the amount of times I've gone for a big hit to get nailed by a x0 or just trying to do 1 damage and I get my x2 is aggravating.\n\nThe sad thing is that I still want to play it often, but hard to get into when each scenario takes about 3 or so hours.

    "comment": "Tl;dr It's 22 lbs of amazing. This is like having an epic DnD campaign where no one has to be the DM.\n\nMostly dungeon crawls, and mostly about killing all the enemies, but as you explore, you unlock new locations. Players can also travel back to the city to re-equip and get random encounters on the road. All players form a party that can gain and lose reputation, increase the prosperity of the town, unlock global achievements, etc. Individual characters have personal goals that once they achieve, will retire and unlock new character classes.\n\nCharacters who complete missions will gain gold and experience, and can level up, gaining access to new skills and abilities. Characters can also improve their odds in battle by completing mini-goals during scenarios. They also can buy equipment, loot dead monsters, or open treasure chests to reveal more stuff.\n\nCombat is handled by cards, and selecting which hand of cards you take into battle can be it's own puzzle, because your hand size is limited. Each round, you use up two cards, but if you run out of cards in your hand, you can shuffle discards, permanently losing access to one of them. If they all run out, you're exhausted and out of the scenario. There are other ways you lose cards from your discard pile as well If everyone becomes exhausted, you lose.\n\nRandomness is also a factor, because each character has a combat deck that could improve or hinder their attacks, with one critical hit and one critical miss card. Players can modify this deck through achievements that grant perks. Players can select which perk to gain, and when a character retires, they can pass some of those perks on to the next character that player will use.\n\nMonsters are controlled by some pretty basic A.I. rules, but each type of monster has its own deck of cards telling the players what they will do that round, as well as a monster attack modifier deck. Difficulty of monsters can be scaled from level 0-7, and each monster type has stats for basic and elite units (with special abilities). There is a fair bit of bookkeeping that has to be done during the round, and lots of little cardboard bits to help keep tack of temporary modifiers.\n\nWhat's great about the game is the narrative arc that takes place during the scenario. Each player starts out with a whole lot of potential, and facing some known enemies, but no one knows what lurks behind closed doors. As they go through combat, their ability deck acts like a countdown timer until they will be exhausted, so there is a rush to blitz through all the enemies, but you have to have a plan.\n\nIn our first mission, there were three rooms, and after clearing the first room, two of us were almost exhausted, and I didn't think we would make it. And when we opened the third door to a room full of monsters, I was certain we were going to fail. But we managed to eke out a victory, and it was very satisfying to do so. The icing on the cake was the flavor text in the scenario book, which has 95 different story-driven missions. Add to that a map that unlocks locations as you play by placing stickers, and you have a very cool game.",

It has something novel in the mechanic department, like the clever use of two cards per round combining upper and lower halves, but it’s peculiarity lies in its grandiosity: almost 100 scenarios, a campaign with new characters coming and going with a few legacy quirks.\n\nI deeply admire this magnum opus by mr. Childress: it has the taste of something never tried before, like packing an entire video game world and hundred of playtime hours all in a box. It immediately feels like epic.\n\nI don’t know, however if I can fall in love with it: the tactical puzzle players are faced with in each round seems enticing and fun to solve, but could also become stale and repetitive after a while. The story, on the other hand, seems quite standard fantasy fare (but going out of the known path with out of ordinary characters and classes is very welcome).\n\nThe initial tentative rating is 7.5.

I decided to buy it for two reasons: first, because I love fantasy role-playing games; and second, because of its high ranking on this very site.\n\nMy friends and I only finished our campaign this year, after playing for two years. The fact that we stuck with Gloomhaven for so long speaks for itself — we truly enjoyed the experience. More than that, the game helped strengthen our friendships, and I think Isaac Childres should be proud that his work has brought so many people together.\n\nI know countless reviews have already been written about Gloomhaven. My apologies if I repeat what others have said or if my impressions add little, but I’ve arranged my thoughts in a simple list:\n\nPROS:\n-You’ll spend countless enjoyable hours with your friends — even outside of gameplay, while preparing the next session.\n-Difficulty can be scaled easily.\n-Huge variety of classes.\n-More than 90 scenarios.\n-Node-based campaign structure.\n-The world reacts to your choices through a reputation system.\n-Failing a scenario isn’t as punishing or frustrating as in Journeys in Middle-earth.\n-Some scenarios are genuinely challenging and rewarding.\n\nCONS:\n-109 pages of rulebook and FAQ (!)…\n-…largely because of confusing writing and a terrible layout…\n-…where important information is poorly organized or even hidden (flowcharts, bullet points, or mind maps would have helped).\n-No organizer included.\n-Some components are of mediocre quality.\n-Additional expenses are almost necessary: sleeves, organizer, and accessories.\n-Increasing prosperity and reputation feels too slow.\n-Players must track too much information…\n-…and yet there’s no official app to help manage it.\n-The sheer number of scenarios can discourage completionists.\n-Some scenarios feel repetitive.\n-The first few scenarios can be overly difficult.\n-While many boss fights are fun, the final one is poorly designed and disappointingly easy.\n-A few classes are noticeably overpowered.",

The card play is the real draw here, as it provides such great turn-to-turn fun and makes the whole game run pretty smoothly, despite the games overbearing nature. The consistent leveling up of gear, new cards and perks allows you to choose your own path to great power. The game is a bit too big and fiddly sometimes though, and that's with us using the Gloomhaven Helper app. It's possible we would've given up by now without it.\n\nI like this more than the smaller \"Jaws of the Lion\" because the characters are more fun and being able to change them is beneficial to its longevity. There's also just more scenarios and a few added things here and there to flesh it all out. I do wish this had came with the fantastic tutorial from Jaws though.\n\nBest 3-4p | Weight 3.5/5",

An introduction round. One round where the Basic rules are mentioned. As my gaming partner did not read the rules, she was a bit struggling what to do and what is best and stuff. So that in the first scenario she was already dead after 3 rounds.\n2. Character overview; how is doing what? Where are the strengths of whom?\nThat would had helped to choose a character more suitable.\nBut on the other hand, I just choose my character based on the biography and I had to learn his strengths and weaknesses during the game, which makes fun.\n\nI would say this is one of those games, I would play over and over again.\nThe legacy mode, the character settings, the amount of Things, the battle mechanics, the typical roleplaygame events it is so much fun to play.\nTherefore 10/10 points from our side.\n\nNext week we already invited some friends to encounter a dungeon with 4 People.\n\nBesides, I recommend to buy a inlay, we bought the Gloombox from laserox.net",

Feels frustrating to miss personal scenario goals and fall behind in terms of perks. Some players can take excessive time to make decisions, though I like the hand management and card selection process.\n\nCharacters are interesting and fun to play, though being locked into one definitely triggers some feelings of missing out on other experiences.\n\nLike playing this, but set up and pack down is a chore, and negates some of the enjoyment of playing. Lots of admin to keep track of, and if not spread equally between players can start to be frustrating.\n\nOverall, won't be for everyone given the commitment involved, but if you have a regular group (who will play quickly and in the right spirit) this game is terrific. Can't give it a perfect rating due to the price and the fiddliness, but certainly an incredible game.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWow the game is just awful at 4P. Downtime is soooo long, often your turn becomes meaningless, and the whole experience feels like a grind. Play at 2P only is my recommendation.",

    "comment": "After having played about 30 Missions/80 hours, I think I slowly get bored of it. I don't see how this is more strategic than any of the other high profile campaign games, for me, Imperial Assault stands head and shoulders above this one. I want to strategize about positioning and more creative missions, here, I mostly are shoehorned into attack patterns. It feels very limiting to have a puzzle on top of a dungeon crawler experience, especially the movement options are annoying.\n\nThat beeing said, I played this online on Steam only, so it might not be a fair assesment, and I played for 80 hours until I realized that I always thought I could be playing XCOM instead. Still, it was 80 hours of quite some fun, I think after 70 I felt the repetitiveness.\n\nI think I prefer randomness of the dice in a dungeon crawler to randomness of the deck. Yeah, your bad card won't come back until you are through your modifier deck, but a 6-sided dice is just much more transparent in what can happen.\n\nBut the worst is really the samey nature of the game. It's interesting for 2-3 missions, but once you understand a character you are playing the same game for multiple missions. There are just certain patterns you repeat. Yes, there are some missions that are not \"kill all monsters\", but the KI isn't really aware if you have other goals, so monsters won't go out of their way or do long term plans to hinder you achieving the win condition (f.e. reaching a certain spot on the map), and it will take a lot of missions to get a new character.",

    "comment": "Gloomhaven is a truly great and unique experience packaged in one enormous box. If you want a huge, well thought out, fleshed out dungeon crawl RPG in a board game format, this is the game for you. There are a couple of caveats, however...\n\nThe game is presented like a lot of RPGs, where you create a party of characters based on a set of pre-defined classes. Your party exists in the town of Gloomhaven and you complete various quests and tasks within the town itself as well as the surrounding area.\n\nThese quests are physically built from a very large collection of double sided tiles that provide a nice functional and aesthetic backdrop that defines each encounter. Typically speaking, your earlier and more simple encounters are smaller and as you progress through the game, the maps increase in size and complexity. Alongside the tiles themselves, you have a large stash of various environmental objects which serve as additional flavor to the environment but also serve as functional additions either in the form of impassable tiles or ones that break LOS, etc.\n\nQuests are played in rounds, with each player character and each monster performing a set of actions based on initiative. Each player selects two cards, all of which have a top and bottom action, and chooses the bottom action of one card and the top of the other. All action cards have an initiative, and the player may choose which of their two cards will be their initiative for that turn. Monsters, likewise, have an initiative assigned to their action for any given round, and all participating parties from both sides take their turns in order. Once a player or monster resolves their actions for that turn, it goes to the next in order, and so on until the round is ended. Once used, a player's action cards are either discarded or lost for the remainder of the quest, depending on the card type. This serves as a sort of soft \"enrage timer\" for any given quest, so parties can't simply rest and heal between every encounter. There's always a sense of urgency in Gloomhaven. Any time a damaging action is resolved, the entity performing that action (Monster or player) will draw from a deck of random modifier cards that can change the impact of that damage by adding or subtracting damage, adding elements or other effects, doubling the damage, or even outright nullifying it.\n\nAs to the quests themselves - Including set up and tear down time, you can expect anywhere from 1-2 hours with some that fall outside of those bounds. There are 95 scenarios in the campaign and while you can't experience all of those in a single playthrough (Certain junctions force you to choose a path in a quest so you can't experience all of them while adhering to the rules), you can easily expect 150-200 hours of playtime out of this box in a single playthrough, not including messing with your characters, buying items, dealing with city and road events, etc. The quests are delightfully varied, and some of them impressively complex in design. The game has a natural difficulty modifier mechanic to make sure that players don't outpace the difficulty of the game, but it is left somewhat up to the player how challenging of an experience they want. You are rewarded for taking on higher difficulties, but enemy strength ramps up quickly. The game also modifies enemy spawns and strengths based on player count, so more is not necessarily easier.\n\nIn between missions you will have random encounters with the other denizens of Gloomhaven as well as encounters on the road to your quests. These serve to provide not only lore and flavor text, but meaningful ways for your party to gain a reputation - for good or ill - which has in-game impacts on various things. As usual, these things come with tradeoffs. Rob a defenseless merchant for quick gains, or be the good guy and slowly develop a good reputation that will pay dividends over time? The choice is yours.\n\nCharacter development is one of the game's most robust features. Your party can contain anywhere from 1-4 characters, each required to be a different class, with one player controlling one character (My friend and I actually ignored this rule in order to experience more classes at once, and went through the game with 2 people controlling a total of four characters at once), and the rules are very intentional about keeping mid-mission communication vague and at a minimum, i.e. you don't reveal your actions for a round until everyone has already chosen theirs, and you can only speak in generalities as to your intentions.\n\nAs you gain experience through certain actions and complete missions and quests, you will find your character leveling up and gaining perks. Character progression includes your standard increase in health, but is also represented in two major ways: gaining perks and getting new action cards. Perks are mostly related to a character's action deck, either adding positive cards, removing bad ones, or adding effects like piercing shields or adding elements to attacks. There are other perks such as ignoring negative effects from scenarios and items as well. This is a sort of slow burn progression which serves to lessen the randomness of the modifier deck and make a character more predictably powerful over time. New cards are also ramped in their impact based on the level requirements but can also provide a more dramatic shift as certain key cards are drawn. This comes at a tradeoff, as the number of action cards for any given class does not change as they progress, so as new cards are acquired, old ones must be left out of the active deck.\n\nIn addition to character progression through perks and cards, you also have at your disposal the usual acquisition of helpful items and gear as well as the ability to modify your action cards after a certain point in the story line. This is an expensive but powerful means to permanently add a large number of different effects to your card such as extra damage, extra targets, extra area of effect, shield piercing, etc.\n\nAs you go along throughout the game and satisfy certain requirements you will also unlock the remaining classes in the game eventually adding 11 locked classes to the base 6. I cannot stress how different each of these are and while they're not all equal in their effectiveness, they are all certainly very interesting to play and very unique from one another.\n\nAs to those caveats I mentioned earlier...\n\nSome of these things can be circumvented by a couple of house rules, and some with the purchase of the removable sticker pack. First off, the rulebook almost reads like you're really only allowed one playthrough of the game. It dictates that a lot of effects are permanent, not just for your party, but for your box. I don't like that. It's my game, I'll replay it if I want to. And apparently the good people at Cephalofair Games felt the same, and produced a very cheap set of reusable stickers to solve just that issue. I would highly recommend this for anyone playing Gloomhaven.\n\nThe second thing people might not care for is the stringent rules around character creation and retirement. When any character is created they draw two retirement goals and choose one of them. These vary wildly from \"Kill X number of this type of monster\" to \"Complete this specific quest line\". These all come with some form of reward, usually unlocking a new class, and generally speaking, take a long time to complete barring some freak occurrence. Here's the catch however, once you have met the requirements for a character's retirement, they retire and you have no choice in the matter. And for the most part you do not get to keep any of what they've acquired. The major exception to this is that the card augments you acquired are permanent, even for future iterations of that class, but since there are so many classes, the odds of you realizing the benefit of that are low. You can, of course, just recreate the same character again, but that's highly unadvisable given the number of classes the game has to offer.\n\nOn a more practical note, this game suffers from its own design quality in a few ways. First of all, there are a huge number of mechanics to keep track of. I'm not saying this is the most complex game I've ever played and for the most part the rulebook is a great resource (Though I have found myself googling for clarity on a fairly regular basis), but for the average board game player, this would be a daunting amount of rules to follow. It's simply too easy to accidentally forget to keep up with things and only remember later.\n\nSecondly, even though the only miniatures in the box are the player classes and the monsters are all represented by cardboard icons, there is an intense amount of tokens in this box, with absolutely no thought given to how players are supposed to store things. This all but necessitates people to spend extra money on either a homebrew storage solution, or an expensive after market solution like broken token, etc. And I might add that regardless of which path you take to resolve this, none of them are ever going to allow you to fit everything back into the original box and have it close. While that is minor compared to a game with bad rules or bad gameplay design, that's pretty disappointing. Furthermore, there just isn't a good solution for how to store the map tiles, which I'm sure is why in the Jaws of the Lion side expansion, they changed their strategy to having the scenario book be the map. I personally like the map tiles but they are an absolute nightmare to manage from a storage perspective.\n\nAll of that being said, Gloomhaven is a truly amazing experience for any psuedo-hardcore board game enthusiast. It's a very well thought out design that produces an incredible number of unique play sessions with a great depth of player choice and freedom. The storage and rulebook challenges should be taken note of, but if you can get over those hurdles, you're in for one of the best board gaming experiences available.",

There are many good games, possibly better, which doesn't get even close as much attention as this gam. After a while, battles in the dungeon become repetitive. Even if you change your character once in a while, monsters, similar locations, even bosses become boring.

It is more like a range from 6-10 depending on the classes you play, the scenario you pick and the people you are playing with. In the right group with the right classes and the right scenarios this game is an 11/10, but sometimes it just feels bad.\n\nPros: Interesting card mechanics, so much content, character building\n\nCons: storage sucks, if you die or run out of cards early you are just sitting there waiting for the others to finish which could take another 30 minutes, some randomness in enemy attacks and rolls, imbalance between characters - as much as I like the game design, some cards are just way more broken than others with no reason to be so different in power level\n\nSide note: I have probably 200+ hours on the digital game, going through the whole thing 4 times on increasing difficulty.

There is a hidden timer and the game ramps up in intensity as you get weaker with each card lost, making for a very exciting game play arc.\n\nWhile gameplay is fiddly with a lot of moving parts, everything flows smoothly with the use of third party apps and I am surprised by how seamless it flows for something of this scale.",

    "comment": "CANT WAIT FOR THIS TO ARRIVE!!! Finally after nine months of waiting it’s here!!!! It’s ENORMOUS!!! Seriously I knew it was big, but once it’s in front of you it’s teuly impressive in terms of content. Can’t wait to play it, sadly been that long the friend was going to play with has left Leeds and think it’s too big a commitment for my wife, who’s a casual gamer at best!\n\nUPDATE When this arrived I was thinking yea he it’s huge, loads of content, but not massively polished and not sure about card driven combat, maybe it’s overrated.... WRONG so WRONG it’s absolutely brilliant. It’s absolutely epic, entrancing and the card system works amazingly well even from level one the card system feels fresh and fun.\n\nI think somehow with all the hugely polished sets from the likes of FFG, that we have been spoiled by in recent years sometimes forget the truly important... how it plays, and this will take some beating. The individual events don’t strike you as top quality when you open it (thin non plasticised cards, board pieces a little shirt on detail, minis not highest quality although still nice, standees instead of monster minis, ringbound missions, etc..) even though there are some very nice touches with regards to artwork. HOWEVER, when you actually put it all together it does begin to look good and when you consider sheer volume of components you are getting great value and actually the functionality of things like ringbound book kick in when you get to playing it (a card front and back cover wouldn’t have gone astray and I actually got a stationers to add an acetate cover to protect it). A lot of people knocked the standees but actually I really like them, then again I’m old and remember them being the norm xand not as good a standard as these, if anything I don’t even think the minis for characters were necessary anc standees would’ve worked for them. Maybe down the line there maybe a deluxe version or second edition that changes this, but having played it it doesn’t need it.\n\nIt’s a bit like video games. The PS4 might be really polished, but I’ve recently gone back To SNES and Megadrive games and whilst they aren’t as polished, the games are quite simply more fun and a big part of that is that they were innovative rather than derivative, and actually the graphics and sound work really well for what they are. It is also like these in that it at that at times you want to throw a controller at wall at unfairness of, or some levels are repetitive, but also highly rewarding when win and has the ‘just one more go’ element and if truly is too difficult or too easy just like this you can adjust difficulty.\n\nThe ambition of this is truly what sets it apart and size of content. It’s 95% there and the size of that ambition is its only let down, with some repeated elements as I said above, which really is inevitable. I have heard people complain about lack of variation however it’s a dungeon crawler with all the positives and negatives of that genre. There is still More than enough here to keep you interested with character development and retirement system (which is brilliant). Maybe a few more unexpected twists and turns would’ve been nice in overal story arc, but road and city events are a nice diversion.\n\nI love it and there’s enough content to keep going forever and a day especially with the removable sticker sheet add on. Maybe eventually I’ll tire of it but that’s not going to be any time soon. Emmersive is how I’d describe it and it’s a truly astonishing piece of work and truly deserving of its top spot placing. Been playing it as a mix of solo and two player and great as both. Can’t recommends it highly enough, but you WILL need an organiser. I recommend the Daedalus one, think adds to aesthetic of game and functionally the best out of ones I tried.\n\nWell after 6 months playing I finally finished it and I can say that this game is almost perfect, the only things that stop it are that it’s so huge and sprawling I kind of lost my way with it and ultimately the end wasn’t as rewarding as it could’ve been and as I said earlier on it’s an imperfect game, but still definitely part of my top 5 favourite games and I’ll be moving on to forgotten circles when it’s released (I also think I’ll play through thsintakingbdifferentnoptions next time)!\n\n9’mknths on I’ve come back to it playing some different scenarios and closing out some personal quests. Something I’d mornappreciated first until now is the character classes make it an almost entirely different game as you try to work out how to use your characters. It can feel frustrating atbfirst if you’re used to a certain character, but it’s a challenge that is ultimately rewarding with perseverance. The orchid doomwalker feels very tricky at moment, but interesting! Also some characters I’ve bonded with (inox brute) and others not so much (Valrath sunkeeper) some I didn’t like to start them grew to love, the Plague caster for instance! It’s still imperfect and with slightly upgraded components (cards, boards, minis) and streamlining the campaign system this would be my perfect game. As it is I still love it and definite top 5 game (still)\n\nEventually took this down to a nine, just on basis of slightly h satisfying on completion and the fact that JOTL edges it in streamlining and fun with other people, however, character unlocking in this is still brilliant as are play mechanics.",

You glance at the five cards in your hand, already feeling the weight of exhaustion creeping in. You’ll need to be careful and resourceful, measuring every move if you hope to survive this ordeal. Discussions with your companions spill into tense whispers—each of you focused not only on the mission but also on your own private battles and elusive personal goals. Gloomhaven isn’t just a dungeon crawler; it’s a marathon. It demands a careful balance of rest and risk, strategy and hope.\n\nAfter Jaws of the Lion, Gloomhaven feels like a natural expansion of that universe. How could you not like it? Mechanically, it’s ingenious and incredibly engaging. This time, the light legacy elements add variability and a level of customization that keeps each player’s experience unique.\n\nOf course, as with any lifestyle game, some fatigue sets in after a while. The story itself leans on familiar fantasy tropes—after playing narrative-rich games like Tainted Grail or Aeon Trespass: Odyssey, Gloomhaven’s storyline can feel less compelling. Still, it’s a standout experience and remains a masterwork in the genre.",

The ones which aren't are usually quick to make so you can get back to the meaty decisions.\n\nVariety: Enemies, level setups, character builds, mission goals (to a lesser degree), lots of variety promise to keep things fresh for a while.\n\nWhy it is not a 10:\n\nLogistics: This game is somewhat of a logistical nightmare. Keeping track of the enemies AI, shuffling all the enemy decks when appropriate, knowing how the AI should act in an ambiguous situation, remembering all your own abilities and effects, going in turn order. Lots of things demand the attention of the players and it is easy to miss things. That's to say nothing of table space requirement and storage requirements.",

We haven't tabled it in 2 months thanks to trouble organising a full session.\n_________________________________________\n\nProbably the best board game I've played. Hadn't played a fully co-op game before this, so was pleasantly surprised at the dynamics. Works best at 3p, seems easy at 2p, and takes a lot longer at 4p.\n\nPros -\n\n1) Keeps you invested for way longer than other board games - I'm expecting a good two years before I tire of this game\n2)The concept of unlockables is brilliant and keeps the enthusiasm levels high.\n3) Every scenario is different (we are just 10 scenarios in), and every monster type adds a new dimension to the game\n4) No dice rolls. The random luck elements are restricted to certain card events and attack modifiers\n5) Players get to customize their characters and develop them the way they want to. Further, each character is unique, so meshing different playstyles is an integral aspect to the game\n\nCons -\n\n1) Takes too long to set up and pack up\n2) Storage. Need a good organiser or a 3D printer if you want to store all the pieces carefully\n3) Tracking damages and monster HP's can be tedious, but we've solved that problem using apps on the side to reduce downtime\n4) Need a dedicated crew\n\nAll in all, I think that the pros totally make up for the cons and this is a game worth its price and weight.",

    "comment": "I’m absolutely in love with Gloomhaven. I’ve completed the entire campaign twice, which easily adds up to over 200 hours of gameplay, and honestly, I could keep going. It’s hands-down the best game I’ve ever played. Everything about it – from the mechanics to the world-building – just clicks.\n\nThe core hand management system is pure genius. You start each scenario with a fixed hand of 8–12 cards (depending on your character), and each turn, you pick two cards to play. These go into your discard pile, and when you rest to recover them, you lose one to the “lost” pile until the end of the scenario. To spice things up, some powerful card abilities go straight to the lost pile, so every turn is a tough decision. To make things even more interesting, you can sacrifice a card to avoid damage, which makes your cards the ultimate resource – they’re your stamina, your abilities, and your lifeline all at once. It’s such a clever system, and it keeps every moment of the game engaging.\n\nThe variety of characters is mind-blowing, and they all feel unique, even though not perfectly balanced. Character progression is probably my favourite part of the game. Levelling up, gaining experience, unlocking new cards, and completing perks to improve your modifier deck is incredibly satisfying. I was sceptical about the character retirement system at first – the idea of giving up a character you’ve built felt strange – but it turned out to be one of the most exciting parts of the game. Retiring a character and unlocking a new one (with fresh abilities and challenges) is a blast, even on a second campaign.\n\nThe game is definitely challenging, but even when we failed scenarios, it never felt punishing. You still gain experience, so even a loss contributes to your character’s progression. The combat mechanics – from the enemy AI and ability decks to the initiative system – are incredibly well-designed. Every round feels tactical and rewarding, and the game always keeps you on your toes.\n\nI know some people think Gloomhaven is too complex, but I found it more approachable than I expected. Sure, it has a lot of depth, but once you get the hang of selecting and playing your cards, it’s pretty straightforward. Some ability interactions can be a bit tricky to figure out, but the Gloomhaven community is amazing. If you ever get stuck, there’s plenty of help online, especially on BoardGameGeek.\n\nThe production value is off the charts. The components are fantastic, and the artwork (shout-out to Alexander Elichev) really brings the world to life. The setting is unique too – it’s fantasy, but not the generic kind. It’s immersive without being overly grim, which strikes a perfect balance. I also love how the campaign branches, making it impossible to play every scenario in a single run. The dungeon tiles are another highlight for me – they’re much more immersive than a flip book.\n\nI’ve seen complaints about the setup and tear-down time, which can be a hurdle for some players. For me, this was never an issue because I invested in a third-party organiser from day one. It keeps everything secure and saves so much time during setup and gameplay. Honestly, it’s such a game-changer that I can’t imagine playing without it. I guess requiring an organiser could be seen as a downside, but for me, it’s just part of the experience.\n\nOne feature I absolutely adore is the random dungeon generation mode. It’s like a Diablo-style rift run, and it’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a tabletop game. It’s perfect for when you want a quick, one-off challenge.\n\nI know a lot of people suggest starting with Jaws of the Lion as an intro to Gloomhaven, but I actually disagree. If I’d started with JOTL, I might not have been interested in the full game. JOTL is fine, but it’s much more limited – no retirement system, fewer unlocks, fewer tiles, and much simpler gameplay. If you’re new, I’d recommend jumping straight into the full Gloomhaven (or waiting for the second edition in 2025). After that, try Frosthaven, and treat JOTL as a fun mini-game later on.\n\nFor me, Gloomhaven is a perfect 10 out of 10. It’s an absolute masterpiece and a must-have for anyone who enjoys tactical combat puzzles, cooperative play, or RPG-style character progression. If you haven’t played it yet, trust me – you’re in for something special.",

Would like to play more but time constraints and balancing playing other board games makes it difficult. Reducing the total time by a half would help.\n\nPros:\n- Wives aren't hardcore gamers but they enjoy the game though it can be a bit on the heavy side for them due to it's puzzle-y cooperative (yet partially selfish) nature.\n- Characters that stick with you and build a history/story going through the scenarios.\n- Rolling a desperate target-add area of attack 2x damage combo to do over 40 dmg.\n- Completing scenarios by the skin of our teeth that were harder than we needed to set.\n- Having the larger campaign that ties the scenarios has better continuity and meaning as to why we are playing them.\n- Fun and elegant dungeon crawling mechanics that give a sense of tension as you lose cards.\n- The excitement of leveling up, retiring, and opening up the 2 mini.\n\n\nCons:\n- Scenarios on normal/hard are on the long side with 4 players and AP prone players. Hard took us 4 hours total setup to teardown.\n- Forgetting to read the rules on the scenario due to the setup rush and finally realizing what we finished didn't count.\n- Setup time is long without everyone's help.\n- Lots and lots and lots of rules. Takes a few plays to realize doing many things wrong even after reading the rulebook multiple times. The FAQs help.\n\nThings that help game running smoother:\n- The FAQs for first time play.\n- Reduced setup time using organization trays and reducing what is needed from the box.\n- Reduced cognitive overhead using companion tools\nlike gloomhaven helper to track monster hit points, action, and modifier cards.\n- Having consensus beforehand on where to go next so that setup can be done before people arrive (or having a dedicated table where teardown isn't necessary)\n\nTags: KS",

The story and narrative is also largely uninteresting, as well as event cards mostly being uninteresting (either a random choice between 2 options or an obvious choice).\n\nAdditionally, the setup time for the game is enormous. There is so much stuff to get out and search through, setting up the map, enemies, enemy cards, market cards, selecting which of your cards you bring into the mission. This game takes over 20 minutes to setup, even with an insert.\n\nWith that being said, the core mechanics of the game (the dungeon crawling) are top notch. The hand management and options you have every turn will always having you making interesting decisions on what cards you're playing, which cards you're using for initiative and when to take a long rest. There is very little randomness in the gameplay, so that is a nice plus compared to most other coops.",

The game is designed to be like a DnD campaign without needing a dungeon master and I feel like they succeeded splendidly. The endgame is somewhat imbalanced as reaching max level often unlocks an imbalanced skill. The implementation of the skill upgrade system is way too expensive and overpowered, and the fact that you have to put stickers on cardboard is unpleasant when you want to start new campaigns. I find it best to just not play with them.",

However, you *really* need a regular play group to play this game, and it's complicated and heavy, so you will often have one or two players driving more complex resolutions like monster behavior.\n\nBalance between classes and options also falls short long-term. It's a little too easy for players to walk themselves into bad or counter-intuitive options which can lead to frustration and analysis paralysis. But Gloomhaven's big-picture campaign format manages to average out these highs and lows into an overall satisfying and memorable experience.",

    "comment": "Well this ended up being interesting and unexpected for several reasons, and genuinely great. TLDR: (1) I loved it, after a decidedly mixed experience with JOTL. (2) I think it’s a rare digital-is-better situation. And (3) Less than 4P is the way to go.\n\n(1) JOTL was my introduction to the system and I have a lot of mixed feelings about it. One can see my full comments there but I played a full campaign with a group of 4. I loved playing with friends but it suffered from a tedious story, mediocre sloggy level design, overlong game sessions, and we were all glad to be done with it. Still, the system and card play was a real winner and I could grok the seed of what it *could* be. Swapping Full Gloomhaven for the underbaked JOTL, playing digitally on Steam, and with 2 or 3 mercenaries, did the trick. I've been straight up obsessed with this game. I've now played two full campaigns and just about every class thoroughly. The character retirement mechanism is brilliant to keep things moving and let you try out multiple experiences.\n\n(2) This gets a rare endorsement of digital over physical. There’s still part of me that longs for that big box, for the tactile experience, to imagine rather than be shown the details. But why deny it: the digital implementation is fantastic. The dungeons come alive, the allies and monsters are great. Lightening the load of all the crushing, error-prone overhead on this one let me focus on gameplay and cruise through scenarios in half the time. I hesitated to award the full 10 since digital is mandatory for me. But the design still comes through. Consider it a caveat.\n\n(3) 4-player JOTL was too much. Too many monsters and way too long. I get the extenuating circumstances with the particular needs of JOTL to get it on the shelf at Target, but it meant cramming scenarios into a printed binder and artificially creating complexity with irritating spawn points or monster powers, but either way, 2P is just so much faster and cleaner. I think 3P is the sweet spot though. Your characters have more interaction and you can really enjoy some support classes. It does mean more enemies than 2P and longer scenarios but it's still tolerable. I’d like to play with another human at some point but going solo and 2/3-handing things worked great (at least on digital).",

We find the tactical battle just ok - deciding which 2 cards to play, what initiative you want, setting up future turns - all very interesting and I can see why fans of tactical combat dungeon crawls feel this is best system. It’s still tactical combat though, and running the monster AI, which is inherently pretty boring to me.\n\nI see the fun in tuning the combat deck as you level up, but I kinda miss dice, and drawing that null card on a huge attack feels way more random than dice.\n\nRunning the monsters is a hassle, especially when you have a 3+ types of monsters, and my eyesight has a hard time picking out the little numbers on each one.\n\nThe leveling up part is a little fun - the perk choices are mildly interesting. I really like choosing between 2 cards to add as new actions.\n\nBy far, the most fun part is going through the story, opening up new scenarios. That’s definitely what will keep us playing.",

You lead your mercenary through the grim streets and twisted wilderness of Gloomhaven, uncovering dark conspiracies, forging uneasy alliances, and sometimes embracing the shadows yourself. What sets this apart is the deep, card-based system — more Euro than Ameritrash — where every choice matters, and your deck is your lifeline. Tactical combat blends seamlessly with evolving personal stories and goals, and unlocking new characters feels like leveling up your own heroic saga. It’s long, it’s complex, and it demands your full attention — but the payoff is an epic adventure that sticks with you long after the last scenario ends. If you want your dungeon crawl with brains, heart, and a little bit of darkness, this is the gold standard.",

    "comment": "Even though I love the game I'll start with the bad:\n- story choices in road and city events are really obvious like 'help or steal' 'protect or kill', there is no moral ambiguity. Your evil or bad choices should be subjective and not universally bad. You shouldn't be forced to be either good or bad to everyone. That's a really traditional aspect of storytelling.\n- Like many said - set up take really long. The game wasn't though out in a way to reduce visual clutter. Just for ability cards you need 5 zones (discard, lost, active, being played and hand). You either need to use some replacement parts (like dice instead of life chits) or get a really big table.\n- Tracking choices is hard. And even if you write down what is this scenario should lead to, you can open the scenario book and find out that it is locked by some achievement you haven't heard yet. Map serves a purpose of tracking your campaign progress but after a while you will fail to remember what place is what.\n- Rules are well written but still contain many quirks. You can be certain at least some rules. Instead of expanding the FAQ, Isaac could have add some reminder text on cards to help you understand how to use them - the cards are quite big, have no art and usually there is plenty space.\n\nDespite all that the game is really, really good.\n- The combat, it's core, is fun and challenging. Choosing what cards to loose for good, predicting how will the enemies move, optimizing your moves with other players - engrossing.\n- the progress really feels deserved - going forward a single level easily takes 3 or more scenarios and when you do level up it unlocks so much that it makes a difference.\n- the scenarios are well thought out. Many times we would win by a hair's breadth and it was so relieving to know we do not have to replay this scenario ( because it take so much time). I actually thought that the game was too hard out of the box - until I've found out I've placed too many monsters for the first scenario for the first two attempts.\n\nEventually we've completed the campaign and sold it. Realistically we will never spend 60 hours on a board game campaign.",

It's simply a work of art and a must-have for any serious board gamer.\n\nI've only ever played this with two people, my partner and I manning a single character at a time as we work through the campaign. The amount of content in this box is staggering. I've had 20+ sessions of 2 hours apiece and still don't think I'm even half way through the scenarios on offer.\n\nThe Folded Space box insert was a necessary buy in order to speed up the setup and tear-down times, and you really need to schedule time to play the game, otherwise you simply won't get it out onto the table often enough. Hell, once it's out you'll probably leave it out on the table for a number of days.\n\nA key part of my collection, and a game I continue to enjoy and explore hours and hours after first discovering it.\n\nSold 2025-02",

This game benefits from being highly collaborative - since everyone plans their turns together, you rarely feel bored waiting around for others to take their turn, unlike some other legacy games I've played.\n\nI've also played a lot with 5 players by bumping the monster difficulty up a couple levels.

(My only one, with 10 stars.)\nMore Informations on 'why' can be found on the tracked Play-details/section.\n\nand much more details comming soon...\n\nlittle Edit:\nEindruck zu den Vorraussetzungen:\n-Es ist wahrscheinlich einfacher eine feste 3er Gruppe zusammen zu kommen um dieses großartige Spiel zu spielen. Zu 4. hat man natürlich mehr Characktäre, die eine Lebensaufgabe haben. (Somit ist Chance höher alle Char. frei zuschalten) Zu 2. klappt auch gut, aber wenige Szenarien können etwas schwieriger sein.\nDaher würde ich ein Spiel zu 3. empfehlen. Aber egal wie ihr euch entscheidet, die Schwierigkeit wird (mit ganz wenigen Ausnahmen) sehr gut durch eine einfache Mechanik ausbalaciert.\n(Wir waren zu Viert. )\n-Auch wenn es möglich ist, die Gruppenmitglieder auszuwechseln, würde ich empfehlen immer mit den selben Leuten zu spielen. (Stichwort Erzählstrang und Regelfestigkeit) Wenn mal, mehr oder weniger da sind, ist das aber nicht dramatisch.\n-Die Einstiegshürde ist ziemlich Hoch: eine feste Gruppe, über 50Seiten Regeln, ein großer Tisch (Esstisch reicht), Zeit.\n>>> Aber die Mühe lohnt sich! Denn das Spiel wird oft gespielt, die Story kann echt gut sein, da man Sie selbst mit bestimmt (wenn man nicht den Faden verliert), und jedes Treffen mit seiner Gruppe wird zu einem Event. (wir haben gemeinsam kocht und zusammen gegessen, coole Hintergrundstimmungsmusik angemacht)\ninteraktion zwischen den Charackter ist ein Grund für den Spielspaß. neue Char frei schalten... ein anderer.\n\nNachtrag: ebenfalls unschlagbar: Preis-Leistungsverhältnis (Kauf 150€ -> ~3Jahre/~80Szenarien/min. 160h Spielspaß)",

    "comment": "Pros: amazing theme, compelling worldbuilding, tons of gameplay diversity with each mercenary being fundamentally different, works well both solo and with other players, tons of enemies enables a ton of gameplay diversity and replayability, writing is really quite solid, has a really nice digital edition that is much more affordable and easily handles all the management, unlockable characters are a joy to earn and open because of how impactful it is to be able to play a completely new mercenary, the balance of scenario objectives with hidden personal objectives creates satisfying tension.\n\nCons: character unbalance, can be hard to remember the narrative's progression and thus understand and appreciate its more important moments, setup and teardown is a beast, can be fiddly without a companion app to keep track of health and whatnot.",

Like my other 2 top choice, this is board gaming mastery. Our group of four is really living the adventures and playing the roles of their character.",

    "comment": "Incredible design. Although the admin and needless book keeping gets tedious after a while.\n\nFirst I don't care much about the legacy elements or the story parts, but it's a great way of slowly unlocking content. It means new players have a limited amount of characters that are easier to learn while more complex ones become available later. Also the starting level of new characters increases over time, meaning even the first character you played will have new options later on that increase or change the experience when playing the character again.\nWhere this design choice really shows is the personal mission each character has. If your character fulfills his secret mission he retires, unlocking new content. This gives you a very specific goal you are trying to fulfill beyond completing the scenario in front of you, and adds so much to the feeling of the game.\n\nWhat makes Gloomhaven so great is how ridiculously well designed it is. The difficulty is well balanced so that each map is finished just about in time before you run out of actions - and balance is great for different player counts as well. The characters are fun to play with combos and cool abilities. They play very different to each other, much more than in other similar games.\nThe card based based combat is awesome. First you don't draw - your cards and available actions are fully controlled by you. All your options are available as the game starts and slowly you lose cards until you are exhausted - its very clever as it adds an aspect of resource management. Your character can burn very bright for few big moves, but you have to rein her/him in to last till the end of the scenario.\nNext you don't play a card - you play two cards. Each card has 2 possible actions, top and bottom. For one card you have to do the top action, for the other card the bottom action, in any order. Meaning with only 5 cards left you still have more than 20 possible combinations not to mention that cards can be used as a default attack/move action ignoring their text. On top of that you know which of the cards you might get back after this or further turns and which not, meaning you want to plan ahead for future combos. It's a brilliant system that deserves way more credit than it gets.\n\nIn contrast to this there is a damage modifier deck adding up to +/-2 to your attack (we're playing variant without miss/crit). It's a good distribution with +0 being very common, +1 or -1 less common and finally +/-2 being rare. While I dislike this (bad luck on most luck based mechanics), you mitigate this over time - permanently. First you don't roll die, you draw from a deck enforcing a certain level of distribution, second as characters level up they change the distribution of the deck removing negative cards adding positive ones. With new characters starting at higher levels you very quickly skew the deck in your favour. To give you an idea - after 3 scenarios I was level 3 with 1 perk, removing 2x -1 cards and adding 4x +1 cards to the deck. I didn't actually count the cards, but I think you start with 20. You can even add powerful bless cards to it for 1 mission by spending some gold.\n\nThis level of randomness in a coop game is fun and I wouldn't change it (coming from someone who wouldn't play the game if it had dice rolling for to hit rolls). And if you like games of chance (first go to a casino and don't ruin boardgames, but second..) you can make the deck more \"chancy\" by removing most +0s and adding few stronger cards to it.\n\nNote that I find the rulebook terrible to use. The rules individually are easy to read and comprehend, but there is many of them and the structure of the rulebook is painful, so finding specific information can grind games to a halt.\n\nTLDR summary: Absolute must-play and #1 is very deserved for its brilliant design and perfect execution.",
