There is a massive overload of information that the new player must know to even complete \"setup\" (and I left out the bonus tiles and bonus cards for the first teach). Everyone's eyes had glazed over after the first round, and we just got through the second round (after 2 hours) before everyone was completely OVER IT.\nAbsolutely terrible experience, and the fact that it's the number 1 family game on BGG makes the whole site's rating system seem borked. (or at least terribly misleading for someone trying to pick games).\nHow many zeros can I put after the decimal point to rate this? I feel a 0.00000001 rating is generous.",

But Wingspan's biggest problem is that it's a very mediocre game competing in a very crowded genre.\n\nThe scoring is so unfocused, that it's a bit of a mess. It's a multi-player solitaire when card tableaus have shown that they can be interactive. Indeed, there's not much reason to pay attention unless playing with competitive scoring.\n\nIt is a bit lifeless on making combo with its cards, in fact, it doesn't lead to satisfying combos 95% of the time - that you only have a limited choice of cards when picking one doesn't help at all. Late game rounds are a bit predictable where everyone just gathers eggs, which is the lamest bit in the game.\n\nUltimately, a dull mediocre game when I have at least 5 card tableau games I would rather play every single time. And they are quicker, snappier, and smarter than this. Thus I end up asking the question: Why play Wingspan?",

    "comment": "A total failure aside from the pretty art, and legitimately one of the worst games I have ever played. Very simply: I found myself announcing what actions I was taking, and what cards I was drawing -- not because anyone had any reason to care, but almost as an FYI. And nobody really did care, because they had no reason to. This is one of the worst problems any game can have.\n\nSome more detail: This one has no meaningful player interaction. There is an excessive amount of luck involved, especially in the form of card draw luck, with no drafting or anything to mitigate it. The engine building here is flat and slow, with no interesting decisions from the cards or elsewhere. There is no tension; you have a 'point-salad' ending, where you get points from public and private objectives, and spamming 'eggs' towards the end. The theme has zero connection to the mechanics and the game feels very loose. Frankly, it's doing well on the market because of the art, and among the 'geeks'/reviewers because of the politics/designer.\n\nI'll contrast this with some good games. \"Root,\" \"Rising Sun,\" and \"Clockwork Wars\" require that you carefully consider all of your opponents' moves every turn; cards allow for dramatic reversals of fortune, but require planning to pull off. \"SW: Rebellion\" avoids the point-salad trap and creates tension based on thematic card effects, clever movement rules, and the fundamental question: Where is the Rebel base? \"Treasure Island\" demands that you try to interpret other pirates' movements as clues to a hidden treasure -- but wait too long, and Long John escapes and runs to find it himself!\n\nIf you're really committed to engine building, and don't mind a lack of player interaction, play \"Terraforming Mars\" (w/ drafting variant) or \"Race for the Galaxy\" or \"Res Arcana.\" Each of those games is about ten times the experience that Wingspan is.",

Sadly, that soon faded as the art and design is really all the game has going for it.\n\nWith that in mind, I have a hard time even putting this game on the table - no one has ever wanted to play this more than once - and even have no further incentive to do so, or in recommending it to others, after my individual experience with the attitude of the publisher.\n\nHeard about the publisher being a bully from others after experiencing this behavior firsthand for myself in a personal interaction with someone from SM. Really takes the shine off of the games from this company, which is a shame for all the hard work that Elizabeth, Ana Maria, Natalia, Beth and others put into this.",

    "comment": "2/5\nBase Wingspan is a solid engine building game. It suffers from luck and swingy cards. The game has pretty much no player interaction (other than minimal over dice and cards). Competitive version (3/5) and Co-op variant (4/5). Old plastic components were much better than the new crappy cardboard components. The company is trying for better sustainability, but they could have used recycled plastic. the new components won't last wear and tear. This is a friendly family weight game that is fun. Reading the rules is a bit tricky and can feel overwhelming, but the rulebooks are fantastic. Learning the game from someone teaching it is much easier. The game even includes easy start guides & cards. Some players can get better draws than other players, but that is common with most card games. The base game board really suffers from spamming egg laying for points. The AI works really well, but there is not much going on. You are still pretty much playing beat your high score, even in the co-op mode. There are tons of bird cards so you can either remove the one's you don't like or play with them all. 200+ plays.\n\n4/5\nWingspan expansions are all pretty solid. Europe adds new bird abilities which are awesome and some new goal tiles. Oceania/Pacific adds in new bird abilities, goal tiles, nectar, & boards. The new board is amazing and addresses the balance issues. Nectar is a new wonderful wild resource (with a small house rule it is perfect!). A lot of these birds favour the new co-op mode which is simply beat the AI. Asia is a great standalone game that can be played without the duet board, it can be an expansion incorporated into the base game, or it can be it's own game utilizing the duet board. The new duet board is really cool and it works well; however, it doesn't add that much to the overall experience nor point scoring to warrant the extra playtime. We are happy to play duet, but would prefer to do it without. Asia also adds new bird powers which are great. The vision friendly cards should have been released all in one big pack instead of individual. We would buy them, but they're expensive. It is exciting to know that South America, Africa, & Antarctica are coming in the future. The coop mode is the better way to play.\n\n4/5\nFan content is really well made. Some birds are great and others in the middle. It is nice to have more content of course.\n\nHouse Rules: Use negative nectar scoring (-5/-2) which solves the overabundant use of nectar. Keeps the game tight.\nStart with 1 resource of each type and keep them (terraforming mars quick start works really well at speeding up gameplay).",

And so often food just doesn't roll your way. There just isn't enough mitigation on the luck and turn after turn of not getting the right food is just so frustrating. Then you have the objective cards that ask you to play certain types of birds, but what happens when you are unlucky and they never pop up on the display board or in your random draws?

You also have a Bonus card chosen from 2 at the start of the game: Achieving any given Bonus card is trivial, but it wildly exacerbates the majority scoring.\nYour ability to compete is almost strictly a function of said Bonus card and the way it aligns or misaligns with the later Goals. If the final Goal is to compete for Wetland Bird Eggs, and you draw the Bonus card to collect Wetland Birds, you are golden for absolutely no reason. (Let alone the way Bonus cards can stack with little recourse if you happen to draw another. You want Wetland Birds with a Wide Wingspan? Pay-dirt.)\n\n\nI am made to understand that the European expansion makes the bird deck a better intrinsic source of points with a more meaningful engine, and the Oceania expansion addresses the general imbalance of the 4 actions available to players, but why buy a $60 MSRP game with two $25 MSRP expansions when you could buy a game with a $35 MSRP that has many of the same problems while being faster and more varied?",

Unique! Attractive! With zero connection to the flow the game! Also: zero narrative!\n\nIt's kinda similar to Everdell in that both games are testament to stellar development - trying to ooze as much from the basic idea as possible, in terms of creating something attractive, accessible and playable. However in both cases the core idea is as stale as possible. Seems like we're dealing with complete misunderstanding what a game design process is about. Just some 1000th iteration of the same soulless unoriginal uncreative MPS engine building. Both games try to add some soul into a JASE and .. it's just eyecandy over a soulless vessel with a question: are you falling for this?\n \nTheme - in Wingspan there is none. What are we building? What are we doing? What is this about? Everdell at least utilises that old eurogame trick of using theme to make gameplay more intuitive - in particular card synergies (which critter goes in what house) - plus it has the narrative of building a city. But Wingspan also has no narrative or dramaturgy. Instead it's appeal is in having a ton of unique cards so that gamers can puzzle obsessively over exploring all possible synergies. And down that path is soloistic dopamine fueled obsession of juggling the puzzle pieces. So many cards! So many combos! So little sense!\n\nMaybe making a JASE as attactive as possible is an achievement of its own. But seems a low bar in terms of game design. \nP.S.

As you \"build your engine\" it gets frustratingly longer and longer as each action now activates previous birds, leading to 5-10 minute turns. There is also an excruciating amount of upkeep and it is so easy to forget to do things (pay an egg here, place a food there etc). Worker placement and engine building should be smooth and *not* so burdensome - this needed more streamlining and more playtesting. For better games in this genre, I recommend Mombasa, Architects of the West Kingdom, and Viticulture.",

Instead what you get here is exactly the reason why eurogames often suck - the theme is completely IRRELEVANT and shallow, it has no meaning to the actual game.

They have a record of releasing very unbalanced games ( Scythe, Viticulture, Wingspan, and Tapestry) and then balancing the game with the expansion. This is predatory marketing. Why do I have to pay more because you didn't test your game enough?\n\nThe only time I have ever gotten DMs about a board game review, was from one of this company's games. Jaime is a nice guy, but some of his fans are sooo toxic if you don't like their stuff. It's the opposite of 18xx gamers, who get mad when someone wants to play their game. ;P\n\nThe game's only good characteristic is that it is easy and appealing to learn for newcomers relative to the weight of the game. And while that is a prerequisite for a good gateway game, it can't be the only thing. Cascadia does everything Wingspan does and more. It's easier to learn. very pretty, and not combative. And Cascadia has actual strategy.\n\nI don't need strategy in my games. But if there is barely any strategy, then I want the game to be dead simple, so I can relax and have fun. This game is not difficult in the grand scheme of things, but difficult for a game where I just want to have a fun and easy time playing with non-gamers.",

    "comment": "Upon its release, I mentally slotted Wingspan next to Scythe and Terraforming Mars as a massively popular but bog standard modern Eurogame (read: \"mostly solitaire engineering challenge which creates complexity through complication\") that couldn't possibly be my thing and that I should stay away from. But then something weird happened over the years: I started getting reports that *non-hobbyists* were enthusiastically picking up the game and giving positive feedback. Was I incorrect in my distant appraisal of the entry barrier of the game? Furthermore, was Wingspan something I would find fun if I gave it a chance? The respective answers are \"in a way\" and \"hell no\".\n\nCompared to the general population, I mostly know nothing about birds, so I asked the local expert: my cat. She finds them simultaneously the peak of audiovisual entertainment and incredibly rude, but has been unable to properly imprint her excitement onto me with prompts such as \"picture the world full of incredibly derpy yet mostly unreachable tuna cans\". I just imagine if tuna cans could poop on my head and efficiently carry various diseases over long distances, and that doesn't exactly bring me joy. Heck, I wouldn't be able to recognise by name 95% of the wild avian species native to my biome in my mother tongue, so let's outright forget about it in English: I can't remember for the life of me the difference between a crow, a raven and a blackbird, everything that can stand on my hand is a piepmatz, seagulls are the noisy bastards that will mass assault your balcony for the slightest chance of leftover pasta/bread, and storks are neat.\n\nAll that to say I'm not exactly entering Wingspan through its setting - which I suspect is the draw for most people - and whether the cards actually do interweave their unique mechanical effects with real-life animal behaviour remains a complete mystery. What I can tell you is that the game follows a surprisingly streamlined core structure. On your turn, you either 1) execute one third of your engine or 2) slot a bird-card in a third of your engine to automatically level up that part of your engine and also grant you access to the card's ability. The three thirds of your engine are: draw food from the food dice (a cost to play cards), make your birds lay down eggs (VPs and a cost to play cards), draw cards from the public display or the top of the deck. If you're anything familiar with tableau/engine-builders, just learn how to refill the dice tray and the card market, ask \"Mommy, where do VPs come from?\" to the most experienced player at the table and you're good to go. Unless you're like me; then you look at your opening hand and your eyebrows get dangerously close to your nose.\n\nSee, earlier, I used the expression \"complexity through complication\", which may sound like I'm just blaming games for me being too dumb to play them. So I'll try to be a bit more precise here. Let's look at pieces from various games and their gameplay-relevant properties:\n\n• A Go stone has 1 property: colour (2 modalities).\n• A Chess piece has 2 properties: colour (2 modalities), shape (6 modalities).\n• A card from a traditional French deck (used for e.g. Poker or Bridge) has 2 properties: suit (4 modalities), value (13 modalities).\n• A Dominion card (as per early sets) has 4 properties: name (pseudo-infinite modalities, sometimes referenced by other cards), cost (9 modalities), type (4 types, also 3 subtypes (including \"none\") for action-type cards), rules text (pseudo-infinite modalities, really additional rules text exported from the rulebook onto components.)\n• A Magic: The Gathering card, as per the early 2010s and over 10k unique cards printed, has 6 properties: name (pseudo-infinite modalities, sometimes referenced by other cards), cost/colour (a large, double digit amount of permutations involving up to 5 different resources), type (7 modalities), optional supertype/subtypes (pseudo-infinite modalities, sometimes referenced by other cards), stat line (one or two single digits numbers, only for two types of cards), rules text (pseudo-infinite modalities, really additional rules text exported from the rulebook onto components.)\n• A bird card from Wingspan has 10 properties: name (pseudo-infinite modalities, sometimes referenced by VP cards in non-obvious parsing, e.g. \"has a body part in its name\" or \"is named after someone\"), biome(s) (7 modalities, still relevant to VP cards/tokens after played), cost (a double digit amount of permutations involving up to 5 different resources, still relevant to VP cards after played), VP value (10 modalities), nest type (6 modalities, notably checked by VP cards), egg capacity (7 modalities, also checked by VP cards), wingspan (in theory triple digit modalities, in practice can be summarised into 3 brackets for VP card purposes), rules text (pseudo-infinite modalities, really additional rules text exported from the rulebook onto components), ability background colour (in theory 3 modalities, in practice only brown is checked), small icons in the rules text (technically parts of the rules text, so feel free to disregard, but 2 are checked by VP cards).\n\nMost of these titles are notoriously complex enough to have maintained decades of a competitive scene (if not more) irrespectively of their components or the size of their rulebook. But the simpler the components, the more the complexity (and replayability, by the way) comes from player-driven/emergent/combinatorial properties, rather than the rules tax of the components themselves. And complicated components are neither a good nor a bad thing, but what they certainly do is massively impair the onboarding process of a game. Feel free to debate the finer details of my bullet points above, but the broad idea remains that Wingspan boasts a CCG level of component complexity, and comes with 170 different bird cards from the very get-go. (It is a testament to the complication creep of modern games that Wingspan is rated below-average weight on BGG.) And it's not like you can afford to ignore the more secondary properties of the cards, because they're part of either your personal secret objective or the common objective of the round. I can't, for the life of me, imagine any framing under which Wingspan is a cognitively accessible game that I would inflict on the average non-hobbyist. (Maybe that an encyclopaedic expertise in North American ornithology might somewhat help.) And frankly, the myriad of \"conditionally matters\" card properties remains a bit overwhelming to an old fart like me. I'm not even unwilling to climb such an entry barrier, but if your game is going to be complicated, this complication better come in service of an exciting counterpart, a sales pitch that makes me want to stick with the mental fiddle.\n\nSpeaking of which, what is even the objective of the game? \"To get the most points at the end of a predetermined amount of turns.\" OK, how do you get points then? \"Well, it's simple, there's a randomised feature that is scored at the end of each round. Each of these features is about player majorities (and your rank within them). So you have to balance how much you want to capitalise on the early game features while they're relevant and how much you want to get ahead in the race for the bigger later payout.\" Hey, that actually sounds pretty cool! \"Oh and also each person has a secret objective that scores points.\" OK. \"Oh and also each card you play has a VP value.\" Er, sure, but isn't it alr- \"And also every card your tuck under other cards, every egg laid down on a card and every food resource on a card is worth points at the end of the game.\" Oh never mind, it's a bloody victory point salad. Woopty-doo.\n\nThe straw men amongst my readers might have politely raised their hand since a paragraph-and-a-half ago, waiting to tell me \"Wowowow, before you carry on with your side-rant, rewind a bit, mister. You're stating that cards are hard to decipher, but come on. In practice it's easy to just focus on the end-of-round objective tiles that have been drawn during setup, on your personal secret objective card, and to disregard the rest.\". Which is a fair experience to have; just absolutely not mine. Firstly, as a beginner I struggle to mentally filter out half of the information bloat, may it be greyed out in an attempt to convey its secondary nature. (Be lucky that MTG has trained me to ignore flavour text, otherwise I'd be complaining even harder.) And - surprise, surprise - Stonemaier Games is happily selling \"vision-friendly cards\" as an additional purchase (ka-ching!) and an admission that Wingspan's cards are bloated enough that removing the non-gameplay stuff from them (outside the illustration) is essential for a good chunk of people to be even able to parse the damn thing. Secondly, when it comes to public objectives, the average game of Wingspan will contain a mix of tiles that care for both the properties they can check: biome and nest. And thirdly, if I can disregard the existence of every personal objective that I haven't drawn, isn't that an admission that what my opponents are trying to accomplish doesn't really matter that much?\n\nAnd that's ultimately my actual main gripe with Wingspan, the reason why I find no joy in playing it enough that I finally find a comfort zone: the whole thing is, as expected, an utterly and dramatically multiplayer solitaire experience. Wh- Oh. Oh no, I made a hyperbole about the level of player interaction in a popular Eurogame by implying that it's null, rather than the small non-null amount there is. I'm already hearing an amount of suspiciously ackchyually-sounding noises in the distance, and I'm now bracing for the \"it becomes interactive once you've played it enough\" or \"but it *is* interactive at two players\" that will follow when they get at range. Just gimme a minute to throw a handful of victory points out the window and keep them busy. Here, done; where was I? Ah, yes, MPS. Sure, you can swoop the food/bird that John was about to draw from the display, and some abilities trigger upon specific opponent actions. But let's be frank, here: if everyone I know is already too lazy (or too socially pressured into a reasonable pace of play) to decipher in-depth the distant tableau of their opponents in Isle of Skye (a comparatively simple game that is more or less entirely about pricing things based on how asymmetrically important they are to each player), what is the actual proportion of Wingspan players who plan around their opponents' turn, when there's already so much to consider when it comes to one's own engine?\n\n\"But you're still racing opponents on 4 end-of-round objectives.\" Oh, don't you worry about that. If you're the kind of player who calls almost any form of player interaction \"mean\", or who imagines that enthusiasm for player interaction has to be a liking for direct conflict (in which case I'd encourage you to check out a small indie designer called Reiner Knizia; 90% of his career is a refutation of that idea), or who deems that having to sit in the same pheromone cloud as the rest of the table already constitutes mid-to-high player interaction: relax, Wingspan has you covered. I'll let you in on a secret. See the board that's hosting the end-of-round objective tokens? Flip it. Go ahead, it won't bite you, I promise. Look, on the other side is... a different, linear way of scoring the same objective tokens irrespectively of opponents, majorities or whatnot. Phew, your game has been saved from the nastiness of other human beings. (Because of the lack of granularity of smaller integers, this technically comes at a balancing cost of later objectives not scoring incrementally better any more, but you'll live.) Joke aside, you read that correctly: opponents are *so tertiary* to Wingspan that it can casually throw away the interactive bit that interested me and still remain Wingspan. It is a solo engine builder through and through that makes Race for the Galaxy look like Diplomacy in comparison. If you love that, awesome! More power to you! I however am not sitting at a table to play alone together. And if I can respect Wingspan for one thing, it's that its official player count drops the pretence and goes down to 1.\n\nAll in all: dude who doesn't play modern Euros tries out a best-seller amongst them and reinforces his prejudice about their complication and/or multiplayer solitaire nature; in other news, water is wet. So where does that leave us? First... Look, I don't know how to elegantly segue into a short comment that I feel necessary about the idea that Hargrave, by virtue of being the female designer who's output the most successful new title in a period of exponential growth of the BGG user base, has no doubt gotten far more shit for her success than than the vast majority of creatives in the industry; and that my dislike for Wingspan is not an implicit blessing for people to behave like twats about its author. Relatedly, in the communal analysis of the commercial success of Wingspan, my least preferred of two conclusions has been retained. Mine would have been \"Hey, maybe that hiring more people who aren't white dudes (with the life experience of white dudes) for key roles of design and/or leadership will lead to games with a wider appeal.\". The industry seems to have instead mostly settled onto \"Hey, this bucolic stuff sells. Let's make more of it.\". I think that Chris Tannhauser was on the money when he said that Wingspan is \"like a downloadable skin for your spreadsheet\", and lots of other titles seem to have followed suit since. This has lately made me wary of peaceful inviting outdoorsy art styles in board games; I now reflexively dread that they're camouflaging a bear trap made of tax return forms.\n\nSo, let's come back to my initial questions. I have now ranted at length about Wingspan being somewhere on the spectrum of the antithesis of what draws me to board games, but not so much about why I was somewhat incorrect about its entry barrier. For all my complaints and my bafflement at how I could even teach that game to normies, the fact is that non-hobbyists *are* picking it up. But not any non-hobbyist: Wingspan seems to do mostly well with nerdy people who are somewhat familiar with the grammar of modern games. Probably that some of them are into birds, or engineering, or both. But even if they aren't anything at all of what I described, the most crucial factor is that they are usually being taught Wingspan by a hobbyist. And that's where, despite my protests, the simple core structure of the game really shines. Do you want to play a card or to run a bit of your engine? In either case, Anita who knows the game inside out can walk you through the proper steps and make sure that procedures are applied and all costs paid. There, done, your turn is over; and if the action you wanted to take doesn't work, you don't have to rethink a lengthy sequence of moves, and it's generally easy to just instead spend your turn producing the thing missing for your initial plan. Freed from the burden of having to perfectly grok the entire ruleset, people who maybe don't necessarily get a lot of their gaming drive from the pursuit of the explicit goal of the game can just read the name of colourful creatures, marvel at the dice tower mimicking a bird house and neatly align plastic eggs (I hear they're wooden now \\o/) on their player board; you know, just be happy to be there.\n\nAnd the illustrations are really lovely.",

    "comment": "Theme: 5/10\nThe theme and aesthetic look absolutely beautiful. Everything just seems very high-quality and well thought out. However, despite the rich details of a bird-themed game, it just feels a bit bland because there really isn't a story or narrative to playing the board game besides just collecting bird cards.\nEngagement: 11/40\nI really wished I truly loved playing the board game. It just that the non-existent player interaction just feels a bit boring to play. Additionally, there are just way to many damn bird cards in the game that it feels like each bird is just some kind of copy and paste with an added twist to it. Also, because there are so many birds, even if you shuffle the deck really well, the game really depends on luck since while playing, you may not even see a card that matches your goals, leaving an unsatisfying and sometimes bitter feeling after playing.\nTime Value: 5/10\nWingspan is kind of weird. Because of decreasing amount of turns per round, it feels really long in early game, but then feels way too fast late game. By the end, on one hand, you wish it could be slightly longer so that you can potentially get a bird to get more points or whatever. But, on the other hand, you wish that you can just play another board game.\nMechanics: 7/10\nThe mechanics are pretty good with some downsides. I love the bird-feeder where you place your resource die and it rolls it for you. I thought that was pretty nice. I also love the deck building palette itself and it progression. However, because of the over abundance of birds, the deck building experience is just not satisfying since you are more than likely to not complete it before the game ends.\nReplayability: 6/30\nBecause of low engagement, I just don't feel like playing this game again. It's just a bit boring to play and I rather play something a bit more cut-throaty, or at least more player interaction to have fun. I would have to say that each game does feel slightly different because of the changing goals per round. However, because you don't really know what bird you are going to get, and it may be the same bird in the same region over and over again with slightly different abilities, the game relies to much luck to really feel a meaningful change per play through.\nConclusion: 3 stars (34/100)\nWingspan is probably a great board game for such fans out there, but it is not for me. I do respect what it's trying to be, and I really love the aesthetic and certain components of the game. But low player interaction, too many similar birds, and an over-reliance on luck really hinders the enjoyment and replayability of the game.",

Your actions affect theirs purely by happenstance. It feels like a game of solitaire in which you all compare scores at the end to see who got the most\n\nEven if you could affect other players it's so hard to tell who's in the lead without spending time memorizing everyone's boards it'd waste insane amounts of time checking over and over to figure it out\n\nAlso the game is HIGHLY dependent on your early cards. If you didn't draw a good starting hand you'll have to spend a ton of resources to mitigate that while everyone else is scoring and getting ahead.\n\nSo you have no way to impede others, you have few ideal options to mitigate your own bad luck and it really doesn't feel fun to muddle your way through with only bad options to choose from",

The card play is too simple to make the puzzle tactically interesting and the market way too small and random to make the strategy interesting.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game is completely unthematic and overcomplicated for the size of the decision space. While the beautiful artwork is a redeeming factor, I don't even want to teach this game to family and friends because of how un-intuitive the cards are. And honestly, while people say that Stonemaier games are overproduced, as usual I find nothing particularly special about the components.\n\nI don't like playing solo either.

However I don't get any enjoyment out of the tableau building itself. Every decision is driven by scarcity: cards are scarce, eggs are scarce, food is scarce, and by the end of the game, even actions are. As a result, the question that you ask yourself each turn is not so much what you want to do, but what you can. Your tableau develops during the game, making actions more powerful, but that hardly ever leads to powerful and satisfying combos. The theme didn't particularly attract me, but in the end it's probably the only memorable feature for me. However it is very superficial, as proved by the different re-skins that this game has had. Lastly, the game is not very mechanically balanced: some cards are obviously much more powerful than others, and during the last turns, getting eggs is the fastest way to score extra points, making other actions pointless.",

Art design is outstanding with vast amount of cards to get it on the table for a few plays without feeling repetitive. Card draw feels ok although some may hate for the luck component, throughout my plays I don't feel there's a particular card that is too powerful, it's just a matter of combination for combos.\n\nNonetheless, this game carries close to 0 interaction with other players, as the 'market' is too subtle that we usually just draw from the deck instead. There is the dice tower for resources, but everyone will get what they wanted without too much wasted moves / hassle. This gets to the table easier for the first time for casual players, while experienced players would find this quite boring as it is just multiplayer solitaire in a nutshell. We also felt the game is dragging out as each action may not necessarily affect one another, but we still have to wait in between. Neither we had any remarkable discussion during the game nor after the game, feels like a dragged out filler.\n\nI would recommend this game to players who prefer to play with low interaction (if you like Fantastic Factories you'll probably like this as well), solo, or likes pretty artwork to give it a try. However this is not really my type as I prefer more interactions (even just a little more). I would give it a 6 if I enjoy more of multiplayer solitaire.\n\n4 - Not so good, but could play again",

Interaction with other players is accidental, like jostling for seats in a mostly-empty passenger car. You're playing your own cards, each one with a unique power and five features/values on it, and hoping for a sweet combo that will allow you to run away with the victory. If I win, why? Did I play better than others, or did the random cards I drew happen to have better synergies? The other players are doing something, I imagine, but l doesn't really affect me so I'll just work on my own puzzle with my own cards and the other chairs at the table may as well be empty.\n\nWe played the green scorecard side, which has some competition for place for the end-of-round goals. Good thing, too, or it would have been almost 100% solitaire.\n\nThe game works, and I don't think it's a bad game for its type.

I just barely broke into the 60s for points on BGA when the winner had over 70 points during the game alone! Some players, including the winner here and winners of previous games on BGA, can build strong engines for tucking cards, caching food, or both just because of luck of the draw and luck of the dice. If you want a card-driven engine builder, try Earth (one of my favorite games!), Splendor (which also is terrible for me), or Gizmos (only slightly better).",

Also, the game is so tight and limiting that it feels more frustrating than fun.",

It all feels pretty random, also after a couple of plays. Have tried this game several times with new players, and they always struggle to catch the game. The last timeI played it was with 5 players, two of us had played it before, and I, the most experienced player lost (I spent a lot of time focusing on teaching the others, but I still feel that the starting cards is crucial and that there is too much randomness going on).",

    "comment": "Update 14/2/2025: Lowering my rating from 5 to 4. I really grow tired of all these spans, just from hearing the sound of them. So many MUCH better games on the market.\n\nUpdate 6/2/2022: Lowered my rating from 7 to 5. Played again after maybe two years. All the fun faded away afther another 4 plays. Very repetitive, several flaws in the design, very restricted play modus, not very engaging. For a player that want's something more, not a very good game after all.\n\n\nWhen I read most comments about Wingspan, I can't help but frown more than once.\n\nFirst of all, there are many nice things to be said about this game.\n\n1. The cover art is striking. It attracted my attention right away as it is very unusual and has a dreamlike quality in its simplicity. It is just wonderful!\n2. The birdhouse is looking top notch and is very thematic.\n3. The dice are of great quality and look very nice.\n4. The same can be said about the eggs.\n5. The pictures of the birds are very beautiful.\n6. I have great respect for the original theme and the amount of work that has been put into creating some 175 cards.\n7. The food chips look nice.\n8. The display for presenting the 3 bird cards is convenient.\n\nMy wife and I have played this game a dozen times now, which can't be said about most of the games of my collection.\n\nI even have fun with the game each time we play and I rate the game a 7, which is not that bad.\n\nThat said, each time I'm playing this game there are things that are bothering me.\n\nIn my opinion there is a LOT to be criticized about Wingspan.\n\n1. Almost everyone seems to like the artwork of Wingspan. I already pointed out the (very) beautiful parts of the game.\nFor my taste that is only half of the truth though. The other half of the game is illustrated very blandly. For example the in between goals board (just a scrap of thick paper actually) and the bonus cards. The personal boards are a miscast to me. Very poorly illustrated, I would almost write ugly. I wonder what Michael Menzel (illustrator of Stoneage and Andor for example) would have painted. I wonder too why the beautiful birds are pitted against a stark white background. Is it to refer to the 'scientific' background of the game? A crème coloured background would have been so much nicer and reflect to old documents of bird scientists.\nThe bird house looks wonderful, but it's not very handy to put the dice in the opening at the back. I understand that some people take off the roof, a practical solution but not very nice decorative.\n2. The card display is convenient but not very nature like. Plastic for Wingspan. Really?\n3. Almost everyone seems to praise the great replayability. It is true that the great amount of cards results in a unique pattern of showing up in each game. Also the strategy needs to be adapted a bit everytime.\nWhat practically no one seems to observe is that EVERY game plays mostly along the same lines. Gathering food and eggs, playing birds, take cards and activating bonuses. It's a tight process that is repeating itself over and over. I admit that this can be said about the greater part of other games.\n4. There are only 8 in between goal tiles that are focussing on birds or eggs. Even as they are double sided and the combination is different every time, it feels as if they are returning over and over and offer nothing new. Sometimes they enter too fast into the game to be of any importance, sometimes they make it for one or two players in particular very easy to get more points than other players.\n5. For a great part the same can be said about the bonus cards. Despite the fact that there are 26 bonus cards it feels as if there is not much different news here. During the first plays I was eager to play a bird and get two more bonus cards to choose one from. Soon it appeared that more often than not they weren't particularly interesting. Well sometimes yes, when you acquire one in a later stadium of the game, and you find out that you are so lucky to have almost met already with the hardest condition of the two. Luck with one bonus card can result in no extra points or 7 points! This alone might decide that you win or lose the game. It is so swingy.\n5. A lot of people say the theme is well integrated. I can't agree with that. If it weren't for the illustrations of the birds and the charming eggs one could feel as if playing an abstract game. We could play with orks and other monsters in a fantasy world, or gather resources on Mars. In other words, the theme feels pasted on. As others have stated, quite a lot of the actions are making no thematic sense whatsoever.\n6. A lot of players praise the documentary 'flavour' text on the cards. Let me say I am a huge fan of flavour text, perhaps one the biggest of them all. I favour even 20 lines of text if they are written well and add to the atmosphere of the game and enhance the immersion. The documentary text on the cards of Wingspan is not written bad, but very, eh, documentary, dull in fact. After a few reads of these lines I can't make myself read anymore, even after playing a game.\n7. Quite a lot of people have made remarks about the luck factor. They are quite right stating that.\nThere is the inevitable randomness of the card draw, which in itself would not be devastating. But there are a lot more luck factors: the showing up of the in between goal tiles which can be in favour of certain players, the unpredictable roll of the beautiful dice in the beautiful bird house, the possibility of getting the right cards in time to make strong combo's, even the random receiving of food or other bonuses from others activating cards (why would one activate bonuses for every player by the way?).\n8. One of the most annoying this is the unbalancing of the starting hand. Someone said: 'The starting hand can make or break your game'. I can't agree more with that. The long term effect resulting from the difference between a perfect starting hand with a bad one, is more often than not decisive in winning or losing the game. I tried the game with 10 cards to choose from at the start of the game and felt it remains swingy. Even when we started with 20! cards, I felt the balance was not right. It doesn't come as a surprise to me that the score tends to go up along with the number of cards to start with.\nI would suggest to start with 10 cards, instead of 5, and keep food as if the players start the game with 5 cards. A certain amount of luck in a game doesn't need to be a bad thing. On the contrary, an appropiate amount of randomness can make a game very interesting. For me there are only a few things that are more annoying in a game than having done anything yet in a game, at the start, and having already a substantial disavantage. This could be so easily fixed to some extent.\n9. Another major unbalance issue is to find in the egg strategy, which is too dominant, as others have pointed out. Playing 4 or 5 times 'the gather eggs' turn in the last round of the game is too lucrative and a very lame end. Instead of reaching a climax at the end as it should be, you simply repeat a robotic action. Where is the fun in doing such a thing? The cost of playing extra birds and finding enough food for them is often just too high.\n10. The point salad. Witch each new game of this type that I play I get more salad diarrhea. What has a game with placing birds in a forest, marsh or water region to do with points? Points for playing birds, for bonus cards, end of round goals, eggs, food on cards and cards under birds... It's feels more (primitive) mathematics than playing a game. Why not inventing a new and fresh goal, reflecting the theme?\n11. In Spielbox I read there is an expansion of Wingspan. From the review I learn there isn't much news to find in the box, just more (European) bird cards and a few new effects. In my opinion it was the perfect chance to fix some of the issues mentioned here. But no, more or less the same thing over and over again.\nI love expansions, especially if they add more options and atmosphere. But I think this time I will happily pass on the Wingspan expansion.",

It has carved out a devoted niche of fans, and largely via its success Elizabeth Hargave has immensely helped women in game design and also spearheads some designer advocacy efforts I'm a fan of.\n\nBut the components and theme (which are admittedly lovely) only take me so far. Otherwise, it's a lightweight engine builder with zero meaningful player interaction, which is a horrible mixture of descriptors for my play preferences. I've also personally experienced the issue one too many times where you never see a single card that would help your endgame scoring bonus. In an otherwise-mechanistic game, having zero control over this crucial scoring mechanism is a frustration.\n\nThe lonely feel of the game—particularly combined with the game's length (40-70 min. is wildly optimistic at higher player counts and most settings/groups)—is the worst offender, though. I could forgive slight mechanical flaws if I weren't in my own world the entire time. As it is, this is one of those titles where I'd rather simply have a drink and chat with friends or family, eschewing the gaming altogether if it actively drives down the interpersonal interaction.",

Gameplay feels extremely repetitive and outstays its welcome when playing with more than 2 players. Very high amount of luck, from the cards that you draw, the type of food that is available, your goal cards, and if your bird abilities even have an effect. You can luck into a goal that gives you a good number of points or luck out and never even see the cards you need for a goal. You can luck into drawing more goal cards that already give you a ton of points or draw a handful of cards that net you nothing. After 10 plays, I'm done.

Not sure which one I dislike more but this one gets one more star for now. It's just another heads-down-and-ignore-your-friends game as you do you best to manage the 6 categories for points/strategy. Ugh! Exhausting. 3 or 4 of those cats are significant to winning -- meaning you have too much to manage and track to be enjoyable. No strategizing just one primary route to victory with a few secondary routes like better games employ. Other players' actions have nearly zero affect on your play. Boring. I played this once against seasoned players who are pretty good... and won by 10 points (a lot). Not fun. The strategy appears to be typical for such games, which is: Manage all your resources with minimal margins to play as many birds as possible. That, while also keeping the round goals and personal goal cards in mind (which, by the way, try to get many of). Then, in the last 2 or 3 turns of the game, make a points grab for 6-12 more eggs (unless you have greater points to chase from cards still in hand -- which you shouldn't have many of by now). Where the game also drags down is reading all the bonus features on the cards. They vary widely and are difficult to grok which ones might be of best use to you. But don't ignore the bonus feature either because this part of the card is likely more important the anything else on the card. If the one's in the marketplace are not useful too you, draw one at random. Leaning towards higher-value birds didn't seem to hurt either even though they take more food to play.\n29-FEB-2024",

    "comment": "Wingspan is a good looking board game that, despite being marketed as a multiplayer experience, essentially functions as a solo game in a group setting. Each player is often engrossed in their own strategy, leading to a sense of isolation as you await your turn to execute your plans. This aspect can detract from the communal joy typically associated with board games.\n\nThe game's most striking feature is its beautiful artwork. Each card is adorned with meticulous illustrations of various bird species, making it a visual delight. However, this ornithological theme feels somewhat disconnected from the mechanics. The thematic integration is not as seamless as one might expect, which might disappoint those looking for a more immersive experience.\n\nGameplay-wise, Wingspan offers a decent range of choices. Players find themselves planning and optimizing their moves to accumulate points through bird cards, eggs, food tokens, and bonus cards. While this offers a level of strategic depth, the decisions often feel straightforward. Experienced gamers might find the optimization process relatively easy, diminishing the game's replayability and challenge.\n\nIn summary, Wingspan is a beautifully designed game with artwork that will surely captivate. However, its solitary playstyle in a multiplayer setup and the disconnect between theme and mechanics might not appeal to everyone. The game offers satisfactory choices, but its ease of optimization could lessen its appeal to seasoned board game enthusiasts.",

    "comment": "+ 3D Printed Deluxe Tokens\n+ Fan Art Pack\n+ Europe\n+ Asia\n+ Oceania\n+ Nesting Box\n\nLet's start with the good. Wingspan is a STUNNING game. Per SM standard, the game's fit and finish is just amazing. The quality of even the MANUAL brought shock to the table. The player boards and cards look amazing. The game is also an easy learn, even though there is definitely strategy and luck nicely balanced to create a fun experience that doesn't feel TOO competitive. For the bad, it feels like the cards can make the game very repetitive, you can possibly not get cool abilities on your birds, and your whole game can be dictated by which birds you're able to get. Also, the entire game is engine building against yourself but at times you feel way too restricted by the game and resources available to even build your engine. If you get lucky and manage to get abilities that give you resources when you lay eggs, or lay eggs when you draw cards, or whichever, it really helps in the building of your engine and it allows those players to end up much further ahead. For competitive folks, this game isn't the one. For people looking for a casual gamenight for 3+, this is a good take as it's generally appealing to the masses.\n\nRating Tracker:\n\nOctober 2022 - 7.5\n\nJanuary 2023 - 8\n\nFebruary 2024 - 7.5 - Not tabling it enough, at all. I prefer Earth for this type of game and weight.\n\nMay 2024 - 6 - Wyrmspan has wholly replaced Wingspan for me.",

I do not believe that the European expansion significantly improves either aspect.\n\nThe huge variety of birds is a delight, but I find some of them too strong. What is really unfortunate about this aspect is that the unbalanced birds are also the most fun from a game play perspective, so removing them from the deck isn't an ideal solution. :-\\\n\nFinally, I found the organizers more trouble than they're worth.",

Still think it is a fine game, but it no longer keeps my interest.\n\nAfter 9 plays, this game is still fun as a 3 player game which keeps the pace moving. Each player you add after that tends to cause the game to drag and I will likely refuse any future 5 player games as I am bored most of the time as the decision space isn't that significant. Avoid 5 player learning games especially due to all the text. Also, the majorities end of round scoring makes the game a bit more interesting and competitive in nature.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION:\n\nEnjoyed my first two plays even though my second play was a bit of a rough play with poor luck in the card draw. Thankfully, the game plays in under 45 minutes so even poor card draws don't feel as horrible as possible and you just make do creating your own bird collection so to speak. Always interesting to see the engines of other people as well and see future possibilities. Each card is unique although a number of abilities are used on multiple birds. Beautiful production - I think one person with whom I played was correct in saying he enjoyed the game partly because of the theme whereas if it had been set in space he wouldn't even have bothered.",

Too much luck of the draw in getting good bird cards. Didn't find the decision space to be very interesting. Lovely, sure, but just not that fun. Not thinky enough to be thinky, and not interactive enough to be fun. Just kinda pleasant and overlong.\n\nMan, this game just isn't fun. I never feel like I've had an enjoyable or satisfying turn. You only ever get incremental improvements each turn, and by the end everything just feels underwhelming. It's just painful.\n\nNow some people like tight constraints, but within the tight constraints here the game is not balanced (like Notre Dame) because some cards are just vastly better than others. So games can end up really lopsided.\n\nPerhaps I just don't really enjoy 'engine building' as a mechanic even though in a sense you're building an engine in most games.\n\nThis game is also both too long and too short. You don't feel like you do very much but the game lasts a long time. For the amount of satisfaction from engine building you get it should be a 30 minute game.

The cards have beautiful bird pictures on them. Various points of setup variety mean no 2-games will be the same (e.g. secret goals, common goals, bird cards seen - all are randomized).\n3) What I loved: Oddly satisfying and since it requires minimal cursory glances at what other players are doing, it is pretty calm and pleasant. Running the engine at the end of the game is satisfying. I like the food dice. Excellent production.\n4) Could be improved: Very solitaire. Even though no two games are the same, the game itself is pretty samey, especially the endgame where everyone lays eggs. Takes way too long for what is ultimately a solitaire puzzle with the occasional nudge from the other players at the table.\n5) A perfect game if you like this type of thing - I enjoy it sporadically but don't need to own it at all.

    "comment": "Perfectly pleasant engine builder that serves to provide a satisfying experience under narrow circumstances when company is mixed. Perhaps best when the entire table is freshly arrived to board games of its ilk (see my updates below). Is this going to be a game I play with my primary gaming group? No. The rules are simple, the tactics fairly light, and there's some randomness (e.g., hawks that gamble for victory points), but this means it's designed for a certain crowd in mind (hint not medium to heavy gamers). Wingspan, in terms of game play, is more similar to 51st State/Imperial Settlers. In terms of weight, Wingspan is more similar to Splendor.\n\nWhile the design aspects fail to express brilliance or novelty, there's some thoughtfulness in the design. In particular, some of the design choices keep the game from sticking around too long (it can be played with experienced players in about 60 minutes with 5 players). The dwindling action cubes keep all the rounds nicely paced. Further, the game design focuses on smartly allowing the players to fire their engine multiple times throughout the game, while also keeping the activation chains from getting too long and bogging this light game down. Light interaction is present due to the end of round bonuses and some positive effects. There's definitely room for some expansions to up the interest, but overall the design feels well considered for what it's trying to be.\n\nThere are some thematic touches in the card powers and how they link to their real life counterparts. The rest of the supposed theming is nonsense, and is simply attractive window dressing (though the offset card market is annoying).\n\n[Update] So it appears the briskness of play is quite group dependent; moreso than some other games of its weight. I've played a few times with people new to the game, and the combination of card effects and turn choices has caused them to drastically slow the game down. You want this game to play briskly for its level of decisions, so choose who you introduce the game to carefully.\n\n[Final update] The more we played Wingspan, the less interest we had in the mechanical portions of the game itself, and there was a growing annoyance at a number of mechanical flaws. Like seemingly all Stonemeier games, there are issues in card design and the concomitant mechanisms (e.g., the low amount of market card churn in low player count games, which results in strings of blind draws). But we still can't deny the charm of the art, production, and little moments where a bird effect causes a bit of a smile. The production and art design are definitely handling more than their fair share of weight, and the game is better for it.\n\nIn any event, we moved on from the game entirely. My wife, after a few plays, declared the experience not worth the set up, especially compared to other options we have, and she's quite correct. And with us finding it too sensitive to slow players (we both hate the experience when Wingspan goes long), we can't trust it with inexperienced players.\n\nWingspan: European Expansion (2019)",

I can understand its popularity, but it is undeserving of this ranking. Also, I will only play this 2 player. Tedious otherwise.\n\nI was surprised by the poor font size, font face, and font contrast decisions on the cards. Also, the \"progressive disclosure\" format of the rule book actually makes the game more difficult to learn and the rules harder to reference later on. Seems to be a pattern in Stonemaier games. I get what they're going for but don't think it works.\n\nDon't believe the hype!",

The art is beautiful and guaranteed to excite bird enthusiasts. On the other hand there are some serious aspects of overproduction, namely the eggs and neat looking but impractical bird feeder. The theme also doesn't carry. Yes, the birds can be thematic and there are lots of them, but are their effects really tied to theme and what's with taking their eggs to lure in more birds.",

    "comment": "Lovely theme, great production, but it's very luck dependent. There's luck in the starting hand you're dealt, in whether the food you want is in the bird feeder, or whether the bird cards you want are available to select. Many of the bird powers also involve luck, such as rolling the food dice or flipping a bird card, and if you get extra bonus cards later in the game it will be down to luck whether they're any value to you.\n\nUpdate. Cooling on this. Besides the luck mentioned above, the game arc can be very tiresome. The first round starts so slowly. Place a cube to take one food. Wait for next turn. Place a cube to take one more food. Wait for next turn. Play a bird card, which won’t change what you can do very much. Wait for next turn, place a cube to take a food...\nThings perk up for the middle two rounds but then you get that final round. You might place another bird, possibly even two, but mainly your optimum move will to place a cube to gain eggs, again and again.\nAs my wife put it, this game is flawed.",

It's light enough, the art and graphic design is gorgeous, and I adore the entire feel of assisting & preserving wildlife. I'm a depressive type who struggles with witnessing so much environmental destruction day to day (...hello ridiculously awful & damaging local Olympic stadium build...), but one thing that Elizabeth Hargrave does is represent nature and scientific ideas in a way which gets players to look stuff up without it feeling forced. The dedication to the theme and production is grand. While it doesn't always work for me in all of their titles, here it absolutely does.\n\nWingspan is not one of my favourite games or series, and I don't own a copy, but I've played it dozens of times and enough people have it available that it makes me happy to know this series is in the hobby.

It's very charming and always a pleasure to play, but considering the amount of attention this game has gotten, one could be forgiven for expecting something a bit more exciting. Mechanically everything works well and, while there are a lot of cards, the effects and iconography aren’t overbearing. The food dice and tower are a bit clunky, but also a bit of fun. I'd caution against those that feel this would be a good game for the family; it's not a light game and has a significant amount of complexity for a game sold at big box retailers.

It's extremely primitive and it's mindboggling how it was not designed with more modern boardgame design sensibilities.\n\nI strongly believe if this game had originally come out with crude art and/or with a generic theme, people would have dismissed it entirely. This game owes SO MUCH to the design, illustration and theme. (It doesn't hurt it's from Stonemeier as well- many people forgive a lot of sins if that name is on the box).

It's a strictly 2-player experience for us, as our friend didn't like how random the game is. Sure, that's a huge problem, thankfully it gets much better with the European and Oceanian expansions - he played once with EE and actually liked the game more, but still not enough to suggest it ever again.\n\nSo, it used to be a 7/10 game for me, 8/10 with those expansions. BUT THEN - the Asian expansion came out. And it works a standalone 2P game! So instead of making our 'Wingspan' deck even bigger... we just swtiched to 'Wingspan Asia' almost exclusively, for a more exciting, easier to setup game. Maybe if we played 'Wingspan' at 3 or 4 players it'd still be played more often, but now it's a 6/10 for base game at most and I think of selling it and expansions, leaving just 'Wingspan Asia' plus, perhaps, 'European Expansion' to add familiar birds sometimes.\n\n+ easy to teach tableau builder game\n+ fun mechanics of activating your row of cards right to left\n+ BIRDS!\n+ nice artwork\n+ Wingsong app \n+ relatively short playtime so you can play it twice in a row easily\n\n- getting the resource dice re-rolled at last is a game on its own\n- several levels of randomness (cards, dice...)\n- usually laying eggs is all you want to do for the whole/most of the last round\n- sometimes you can't get any reasonable points from personal bonus objectives\n- feels like there's no coming back to playing the game base box only after you've tried EE and/or OE once\n- 'Wingspan Asia' is just so much better (but only suitable for 2 players)",

I dislike that you're so much dependend on what you draw and can't influence it and good choices are obvious - so the game plays you not vice versa. If you're up for card combos I'd recommend Race for the Galaxy or Deus.\nThe other problem with wingspan is, that it is lacking strategic depth (as explained before) and therefore not desireable for hard core gamers, but is still quite a lot to manage and overview and thus for newbies or casual players a bit too frustrating.

    "comment": "Wingspan is a beautiful game and its setting an absolute delight. I like it to look at and learn about the birds and having components so nice is a joy. There are a variety of different strategies to follow, one has to plan ahead and finding good combinations makes you feel clever.\n\nUnfortunately it's belonging to a genre I'm not all too interested in (engine/tableau builders). Wingspan is another game, where players don't care about other player's turns at all (despite competing for round goals), which is especially sad for a \"family game\". Also luck of the draw has to be on your side, some of these birds will give you a rough start and bonus cards can feel like nonsense. But nobody will care or notice, because they are busy with their own bird thing.\n\nBoth thumbs up for top notch bird setting and bling, which I very much appreciate. In terms of play, not my game, not my category, not my philosophy of playing together. Still it's nice many others enjoy it so much.\n\nUpdate: My bird loving partner kept being interested in Wingspan. It felt wrong to be a snob, I gifted her a copy plus the european birds expansion and she was super happy about it. Despite my reservations towards the game I can imagine it will get some additional uplifts for the two of us and I'm looking forward to play with her.\n\nUpdate 2: About a dozen more plays and I've experienced some highs and lows. My positive impression about the presentation remains, I'm fully supporting the trend for more peaceful settings and in that regard Wingspan is a charm. With two or three players, knowing what they are doing, Wingspan is also a good game (rating 7) and I'm happy to play Wingspan with my partner plus maybe one more person. Though in our standard setting with four (slower) players, Wingspan can be really boring (rating 4), which feels even worse when you are waiting 5-10 minutes for your 5-10 seconds turn or while it's going bad for you. Reading all your bird's flavor texts is nice, but that's not how I want to spend my gaming nights. My rating reflects this average score.",

    "comment": "1 play.\n\nI enjoyed myself, and had a few sequences of several turns where I hatched a plan, executed it, and felt satisfied. The mechanisms for building the engine are pretty thematic, which is satisfying -- getting the food that that bird eats, playing the bird which requires that food and maybe an egg, placing it in its habitat, and then being able to execute its special abilities. Those abilities are thematic, for the most part -- being able to attack other birds under a certain size, collecting food, sneaking eggs into other birds' nests. The components are very good.\n\nBut overall, I felt a bit unsatisfied. Rather than feeling coherent, like I was building a fish-creating engine and getting more and more waterfowl and fish, it all felt a bit miscellaneous. The randomness of the goals added to this sense of arbitrariness, as did the point salad at the end of the game. It helps that you can see the eggs and cached food visibly; it would help if you could more clearly see the bird points, like maybe higher values could be larger and more colorful. I will need more plays to see if more familiarity makes it feel more coherent.\n\nI did like several mechanics a lot: being able to draw from the three visible birds, or to draw a random bird; having both publicly visible goals and secret goals; having limited food and needing to strike fast to get the food before other birds do.\n\nThe instructions are bad, with three completely separate documents all claiming to be the ones that you should read for your first play, and conflicting advice about shared goals for beginners (play the \"default\" side, or play the, um, other side?). The game isn't very complicated, really, and doesn't need the confusing separate pack of beginner cards.\n\nFirst of all, the instructions around the four types of move you can make each turn are far too complicated! Instead of starting by listing the option to play a bird card (which raises the question, which habitat would you want to play onto?), it should start by explaining that you can ALWAYS a) collect food; b) lay eggs; or c) draw cards. But, you start with each of these being slow -- just one food, just two eggs, just one card. Want to use the faster options, to the right? Then you'll need to choose option d), placing a bird card in your habitat. Why play bird cards? Well, the a/b/c actions that you can take in each row is the leftmost one showing, so placing birds onto that row will make it more powerful. You can place a bird if you qualify for three constraints: 1) you have to place it in the habitat it lives in, in the leftmost open space; 2) you have to pay the food it eats, when you place it; and 3) you have to pay some number of eggs for it to hatch (usually one egg; for the first bird in each habitat, zero eggs.)\n\nFor another thing, the action tokens are almost completely unnecessary; their only function in a typical turn is 1) to count the turns remaining, and 2) to act as a pointer, like a reading finger, as you go down your row of birds using their abilities. The first thing the instructions could do is tell you, in large letters, that the action tokens are only to help you remember the steps of your turn, and have no actual function in gameplay! Just instruct players to put them onto the left side of their habitat board. In a note later, you can suggest that players use the right-to-left trick, which does help track their turn, but changes nothing about actual gameplay.\n\nBird cards are a crucial element of the game, but there isn't a prominent place near the start of the instructions that diagrams a typical bird card and explains what the various areas of the card mean.\n\nThere are also many rule ambiguities, and these could be addressed with clearer language, and maybe a few prominent frequently asked questions. Do you \"activate\" a bird when it's played? (No; players in my game weren't sure.) Can you spend \"cached\" food? (No; we were 10 turns in before we realized this.) Do birds with wild card food count for goal cards that describe birds that eat a particular food? (No; this could simply be made explicit on these cards themselves.) Does \"drawing\" a bird card mean you can take it from either the display or the deck? Does the \"deck\" include the tableau of three public cards? Etc.\n\nHeaviness: 3 out of 5. Really not very complicated, if explained well.",

For online play in BGA it is too clear when you are behind that the last few turns are mostly going through motions, pretty rarely you actually have a chance to affect the result in the later rounds. The interesting stuff is the first couple of rounds and to me that isn't really that interesting. Still, this amounted to 20 plays in BGA and a few IRL plays and likely some more to come with my daughter, so not exactly bad if not stellar.\n\nThen again, I played Wyrmspan solo recently when I had it on a short loan and it does away with the bird feeder but otherwise it seems like fiddly development version of Wingspan with worse theme.\n\n----\n\nAfter further online plays I'd say that async it is about an 8 due to kack of downtime.",

Manipulating dice for food with out really being able to manipulate dice made it a frustrating game for us and while there were options to mitigate that a certain amount, shop with only 3 birds made it impossible to get good birds in bigger games (since everyone else got them).\n\nSo it was a game made by luck of the draw and luck of the throw, which I'm not a fan of.\n\nThe art was gorgeous on the other hand, but talking about cards, again I'd say there were many problems, especially with lazy design of certain cards and many same/ey powers with birds.\n\nThe expansions fixed that A LOT imho and nowadays Wingspan is a much more enjoyable game for me. I would usually want to play it, but not for the entire game night.\n\nThe real problem with Wingspan is its younger brother - Wyrmspan, which imho is one of the tightest and most well designed (simple) games we have. It's very well made and manipulating dragons to do this or that is much more fun than waiting for birds to do their stuff. Wyrmspan is our GOTY 2024 which I never thought would happens with a simpler game, since I always prefer complexity and very heavy games. AND there are dragons.",

    "comment": "Review based on 26 plays (12/09/2025)\nIncluding:\n- European Expansion\n- Oceania Expansion\n- Asia Expansion\n- Swift Start Promo Cards\n\nWingspan has seen a lot of play as it is a favorite of my wife, but I'll almost never choose to play it myself. While Wingspan has gorgeous artwork and beautiful components, the gameplay is a little lackluster. Being primarily an engine builder, I find it a pity that most bird effects are slight variations of a relatively small amount of mediocre effects. There are especially a lot of luck based cards, where profit is not at all guaranteed. This leads to an experience where it often doesn't feel particularly exciting to acquire new bird cards. Also the fact that a lot of cards are similar, but not exactly the same, imposes the need to carefully read every card that appears in the bird tray (recognition based on artwork alone is not possible due to the large amount of different cards). Since the tray is refreshed so often, this can be a little exhausting, which is not ideal for a family game. It interrupts the game flow too much.\n\n\nThe new bird cards that were added in the expansions, as well as the nectar mechanic from Oceania and the duet mechanic from Asia, help to spice up the game. We use the Oceania boards and the Duet board by default now (using 2 standard goal tokens and 2 duet goal tokens). Also, the increased amount of goal tokens and bonus cards contributes to the fact that every game plays quite different compared to the last one, as it urges players to try out new strategies. That is something I highly appreciate. Nonetheless, I find that for a game which is primarily an engine builder, you have too few turns to really reap the benefits of your engine. And that leaves me always a little underwhelmed at the end of a game (even if I win). As a side note, I will only play Wingspan with two players. Adding more players will barely increase the player interaction, and only add unnecessary game length.\n\nRecently I was able to play a friend's copy of Wyrmspan, and I must say I did like that one much more. I won't go into details here, but having played Wyrmspan makes it even harder now to go back to Wingspan. Nonetheless I must admit that I'm slightly curious for what the upcoming Wingspan expansion might offer. Maybe that one is able to restore my faith in this game? Time will tell.",

The game play integrates super well with the theme. Although turns are quick, there is rarely any reason at all to pay attention to the actions of anyone else other than competing for the awards.

    "comment": "Its fine. It was my first real taste into the mechanics of a tableau engine builder and it was wonderful. My main issues are that there are too many ways to get blocked in the game. Either you don't draw good cards that match the goals, or you start with good cards then never draw them and end up changing things up which just slows you down, or you never get the resources you need so you need to burn resources 2:1 to make up for it while everyone else at the table is getting the right cards and is never strapped for resources. Usually one negative happens to someone at the table at EVERY game. Could house rule some things like dumping cards you can't use for a redraw or who knows but overall there are far better games with similar mechanics. I will say the art is amazing but great art will never beat a better game.",

You’ll do this by carefully building your habitats, where each bird you play makes your actions stronger and more efficient.\n\nEvery bird you add links into your growing chain of combos, making each round more powerful than the last. At the end, tally up points from birds, eggs, food, and goals whoever has the strongest preserve takes the win.\n\nRelaxing, strategic, and birds ? , Wingspan is a game where every move feels satisfying.

As your actions get more powerful throughout the game you really feel a sense of progress.\n\nMy absolute favourite thing though is the turn structure and player mat. It’s so simple and really brings out the engine building feel of the game. Every time you play a bird in a habitat, you really feel the progress it gives you through the great design of the turn structure and player mat.\n\nI also really enjoy the competition and interactions with the other players through the goals and birdfeeder, although I do hope for some more indirect interaction from expansions.\n\nWingspan is a brilliant little engine builder that plays it a very reasonable time and has a pretty good depth to it - I really recommend it.",

It's really more of a solo engine building efficiency puzzle with other players there to periodically remove dice and cards that you might like to take for yourself. There are other areas of interaction, like the fight for end of round bonuses, cards with effects that trigger on other players' actions, and cards that affect all players. This is really more of an experience, something to do to work the brain a little and pass the time and relax, like Sudoku, than a game proper. I personally wouldn't consider this a top 40 game of all time, but for what it is, it does it very well. From a design perspective, it's very sleek, and I like the three tracks, and the tension between needing to work all three tracks, while at the same time each track gets stronger the more you specialize. If this was Hargrave's first design, it's extremely strong, especially considering the huge variety of different bird cards.",

    "comment": "Some say this is Terraforming Mars light and I can see why as you have a lot of different cards and you somehow chose your strategy. But as this game only last 4 rounds, it makes you're more luck dependent then in Terraforming Mars. Especially the ones that generate points during the game seem a must have is my impression after 2 plays, as it was 2 times the player who scored the best in this category who won the game. That's why I give it only a 7: with equally skilled players, it's the one whom drafts the best cards whom will win.\n\nUpdate 17/10/2025: Sure, you need some luck with the combo birds/bonus cards, but it's also a relatively short game, especially with 2 players whom are experienced.",

A bold statement, and I am fairly new to modern board games, but this hits with me. I’m not even a bird guy, but I love this game.\n\nThe art on the cards is great. I end up spending a handful of seconds just looking at the birds as they are drawn and played. And the production quality is well above average, particularly with the game boards and cards. I wish all playing cards in board games felt as nice as these. And, come on, it comes with a dice tower shaped like a bird house. That's awesome. I will eventually swap out the tokens and action point cubes for some 3D printed ones, but the default ones do their job just fine.\n\nApart from the great components, the simple, cozy game flow just scratches the right itch: A little bit of luck with a little bit of strategy and depth. Getting that engine going, and reaping the rewards of careful card placement is one of my favorite mechanisms in games, and this is my favorite example of that so far.\n\nOh, and my (not-at-all-a-nerd) wife loves it, so getting it to the table is not difficult for me. I have zero desire to play this solo, so I couldn't care less how good or bad the solo mode is. For me, this is a game to relax and enjoy with my wife and/or friends. Which I see us doing a lot and for a long time. So much so that it's likely I'll eventually get Wrymspan and/or Finspan.\n\nThis game is widely beloved for good reason. Highly recommend.",

It make this game a great couple game too, as it doesn't feature \"take that\" or any negative direct player interactions (all the interaction is indirect where you need to monitor what the other players are doing). Also, my wife find this game \"relaxing\" and enjoy it a lot.\n++ Great components! The player boards has a nice matte finish, eggs are awesome, the included Game Trayz is nicely designed and the birdfeeder dice tower is a nice addition.\n++ Easy to teach, fast to setup and fast to play.\n++ There are expansions for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).\n++ The European expansion is mostly \"more of the same\" which is good because it brings a lot of variety to the game: more public objectives, more bonus cards and, of course, more bird cards (with the new End of round abilities).\n++ The Oceania expansion has also a lot of \"more of the same\" like more public objectives, more bonus cards and, of course, more bird cards (with the new End of Game abilities), but also add up a brand new mechanics, the Nectar, which make the game for strategic than tactical as with Nectar, you are way less often stuck with the wrong food type to deploy your engine faster, so it open up the game.\n++ The Oceania expansion cards are really made toward more positive player interactions with multiple players (abilities like choose any player, checking your opponent to your left or right, etc.) which make the 3-5 players game more interesting, but the 2-player experience is less fun with these cards especially for power that give yourself and one of your opponent the same thing for example.\n++ The Oceania expansion new player boards speed up the deployment of bird by enhancing the food engine and the card draw engine, so overall, I think these boards are better, especially for people that wish even more control, as these feature a few \"re-roll the food dice\" and \"refresh the bird tray\" abilities.\n++ The Asia expansion is mostly \"more of the same\" which is good because it brings more variety to the game: more objectives, more bonus cards and, of course, more bird cards, but no new ability type. Basically it's what most playerw are looking for anyway.\n++ But the Asia expansion also introduce two new modes of play: the Duet mode, which is a 2-player only mode with the Duet map, which is a nice small twist on the game, and the Flock mode, which enable the game to support 6 or 7 players.\n++ The Nesting Box is overall really well made and organize the game really well, with stuff organized in the way it should, as you use them and put them to the table from top to bottom: rulebook and player mat on top; cards, ressources trays and bird feeder dice tower in the middle layer; and extra expansion stuff / spare room at the bottom. Ressources trays are well made and goes straight to the table making setup and tear down a breeze. The box itself have ample room for everything released so far, and I really believe it will be big enough for the last 3 expansions planned (Latin America, Africa and Antarctica). I really recommend it for people that love the game and plan to have several (if not all) expansions in order to store everything in own single box.\n\n\n NEGATIVE POINTS:\n\n-- The game is a tiny bit more luck-based than I would like, thus you have to have a more tactical mindset when approaching this game (as you will not do exactly what you want to do, but what you can do with the card you get).\n-- There are several small misprints on the cards and rulebooks of the first and second printing of the game. Most misprints are minors and don't affect gameplay (like the \"Once betweeen turn\" typos or the typos I found in the rulebook or the appendix), but there are at least 2 misprints that affect the game, namely the one on the Photographer Personal Bonus Card (it should read that 4-5 birds give 3 points and not only 2-3 birds) and the Spotted Sandpiper Bird Card (it should be worth 5 points and not only 4)). There is also a duplicate art for two different birds, the Cassin's Sparrow (which is correct) and the Cassin's Finch (which should be different). The appendix also doesn't have all the bonus cards explanations or the birds explanation. This is really unfortunate as the production is great, but the proofreading part was a bit deficient. But, Stonemaier Games really take their customers at heart and have fixed their mistake for early adopters like me, by providing a small booster pack of cards with corrected cards, so kudos to them for this awesome customer service\n-- The playtime is a more than what the box suggest at higher player counts: at 2-player you can definitely play this in 45-60 minutes, but adding more players add more time proportionally, so playing with 4 or 5 players is around the 120 minutes mark.\n-- The Oceania expansion cards are really made toward more positive player interactions with multiple players (abilities like choose any player, checking your opponent to your left or right, etc.) which make the 3-5 players game more interesting, but the 2-player experience is less fun with these cards especially for power that give yourself and one of your opponent the same thing for example.\n-- Unfortunately, the color of the Nectar (darker pink) is really close to the color of the berries (red) and they are often mistaken when getting food tokens. I wish that it was a lighter/paler pink.\n-- In the Asia expansion, the Flock mode, to support the 6 or 7 players count, isn't really interesting and with that kind of player count, I will just choose another game.\n\n\n OTHER GAME INFO:\n\nGame Weight = 2.5/5\nRelease Date = 2019\nNumber of Player = 1-5(7) (SOLOABLE)\n1-player length = 30 min.\n2-player length = 45-60 min.\nX-player length = 60-120 min.\nPlayer Count Preference = Best at 2, great at 3, recommended at 1 and 4!

    "comment": "Good game, hard to say if the birds and special powers are balanced, and the diferent objectives cards are balanced. But still it’s an enjoyable game.\n\nFAQ:\n\nCan you discard birds from your player mat?\n- No, once you play a bird, it’s permanent.\n\nWhen I gain food from the birdfeeder, do I choose all of the dice at once, or one by one?\n- Choose dice one at a time. This creates the potential for you to reroll in between dice selections.\n\nMy bird card says ‘WHEN ACTIVATED: Gain 1 [food type] from the birdfeeder, if there is one.‘ There’s another bird card that says I can gain a specific food “if available.” Can I reroll if there’s only one type of die face in the feeder?\n- Yes, regular reroll rules apply whenever you have the opportunity to gain food (see “Managing the birdfeeder”).\n\nWhen activating “migrating” birds that can move from one habitat to another, does the action token move with them? Can they move even if they’re the only bird in the original habitat?\n- The action token stays with the original row, as that’s the action you chose for this turn. And yes, even if the bird is the only bird in the original row, they can fly over to another habitat (the point is just that they can’t move if there’s a bird card to their right).\n\nWhen a bird says that I can “repeat” another bird’s ability in the same habitat, how does that work?\n- Basically, it means that you can re-activate any other “when activated” bird in that habitat. It doesn’t matter if you’ve already activated that bird or not this turn. Also note: the “repeat” bird is not copying the power for itself.\n\nAutoma: Who goes first each round, you or the Automa?\n- For each of the 4 rounds, you always go first and the Automa always takes the last turn.\n\nIs the percentage on the Omnivore Expert bonus card correct?\n- No, it should be 16%, not 10%.\n\nDoes “prairie” count as a term for the Cartographer bonus card?\n- Yes, it counts.\n\nWhat does the Photographer score for 4-5 birds with colors in their names?\n- This is a typo. Instead of 2-3, it should say 4-5.\n\nShould the Spotted Sandpiper be worth 5 points, not 4?\n- Yes, 5 is correct.",

I can't ever get enough Wingspan, I'm excited to play it every single time, and I can't imagine it ever slipping from my top ten list.",

As in, \"oh, hey, innovative game design and mechanics have finally found a mainstream audience.\" As me and the S.O. are already birders, Wingspan was a natural place to start and it scratched both a gaming and real-world-simulator itch simultaneously. It helps that each and every game, bar none, is different from game set-up through the end, forcing flexible strategies and tactics to adapt to ever-changing conditions. Kind of like a real ecosystem, ya know?",

As my favourite animal, it's exciting to see birds thematically used in such an excellent and well-balanced game mechanically.\n\nRating 8/10 for the base game, 10/10 with Oceania expansion (essential and fun) and Asia expansion for the flock mode addition. The Europe expansion is not essential but is nice, and the nesting box (big box) to store everything has come in handy. Definitely recommend flock mode for 5p games as well - it's revolutionary. Also recommend the speckled eggs which add lovely new colours and are needed for higher player count games.\n\nThis game will always be in my collection. It is great at all player counts (with flock mode 5-7p) and always plays an interesting and usually close-scoring game with varying victory pathways.",

There are endless replayability with all the different birds, and I love that all the birds are viable in the right situations. My love for birds make this game even better.\n\nIt feels like a more relaxed and shorter version of Terraforming Mars. In comparison, Wingspan's cards differ less, so most cards can probably work no matter what strategy you chose. In TM, there are cards that fits perfectly to some strategies, while not at all in others, making it more tense. Wingspan is more playing with your gut and going with the flow.\n\nI would probably rate this an 8 without expansions, because of the slight imbalance where egg strategies often are too powerful, making most games too similar and not as fun. The expansions fix this.",
