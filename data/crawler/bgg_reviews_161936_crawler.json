How is this so high on BGG I’ll never know. There was a lot of hype for me which may have ruined my experience because the game is simply mediocre. Very expensive game for only 15 plays(about 10-12 hours), no replayability and no resellability is bad enough on its own. Now about the game - the story was presented very good in the first 8/12 (8 months), I was really impressed actually, especially with the sticker stuff and box oppenings. After that the story went straight downhill, becoming mediocre and plain stupid at times with the least interesting ending ever. It was super easy to miss/accidentally change a rule here-or-there and there is absolutely no way to fix the mistake or replay the game - almost every month we did something wrong... We quickly saw our mistakes, and they were about 50/50 bad/good making the game very easy/insanely hard at times but still it makes you wonder what it should have been!\n\nI really think if this was a two-year game (24-48 games) for the same prise tag (or a few bucks more) they could have made the story much much better with super cool ending and with more time to have small mistakes matter less. Instead we have this - extremely overpriced, anti-climating, unsellable, unresettable piece of cardboard, I’m very dissapointed!\n\nHaving said that - the first 8 out of the 12 months of the game were actually pretty fun but I still can’t recommend this to anyone (...or give/gift my copy to anyone...)",

    "comment": "My wife and I love the cooperative board game pandemic - by far the game in our collection we play most frequently. And we've also very much enjoyed other games in the pandemic series (e.g. Pandemic: Rome). So, we decided to splurge on Pandemic Legacy, and looked forward to playing with great excitement.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It was one of the worst games I have ever played. More or less unplayable. I hope someday to overcome the negative associations to the point where I can enjoy the original pandemic again.\n\nThe first few months were a lot of fun, Pandemic with mild rule twists and upgrades that kept us playing. But around the \"May\" objectives it turned into a disaster of a game.\n\nThe problems ranged ranged from simple things that were just annoying to major gameplay problems. Some simple things: **Instructions out of order (It would say \"read instructions 17, 36, 41, and 12) and you'd have to try and find them.\n**Scratch off pieces, like on lotto scratchers, that are entirely unnecessary and create a mess\n**Game designed to have no replay value - using stickers instead of replaying pieces (not that I'd want to replay this, nor would I impose a game this bad on a friend, but still, it's the thought that counts)\n\nMajor Gameplay problems:\n**Some levels were designed to be unwinnable. My wife and I play normal pandemic on the highest difficulty level and win about 80% of the time. Here, when we hit May we lost. We tried replaying the level (just for \"fun\", not for the legacy element) using different characters, different combinations of upgrades, etc. to see how we might have won, and we could not beat it. After losing many times, we recorded what we had drawn and retrospectively evaluated what we could have done differently to win, and we could not find any pathway to victory, even knowing what cards would be drawn. This was despite the fact that we had won every previous level easily, with 1 or fewer outbreaks per level.\n\n**When you lose a level, the game gets harder, both because of new rules and challenges and because all the losses are retained. Thus, if you can't beat a level, it will only get worse from there.\n\n***Eventually, when you lose enough, the game helps you out by giving you advantages that allow you to win easily, but it feels completely unearned. Once you get those extra bonuses, it's hard not to win. But you didn't earn them. So victory feels hollow.\n\n*** The plot (no spoilers here) jumps the shark.\n\nIt's hard to go into more details without adding spoilers, but there were so many problematic mechanics, that I can't see how anybody could enjoy this game, and am honestly baffled by the mostly positive reviews. My wife and I boardgame a lot, and have a sizeable collection of games, and for this I wish I had the hours of my life back.",

I have no objection at all to Campaign/Legacy games, it's an interesting concept. However in this case, the designers and/or publisher went too far, by deciding to make the game unplayable once the campaign is done. Instructing players to literally break the game while playing. Components easily could have been provided to avoid permanent modification of the game pieces, such as tokens, counters, notepads, erasable pens and cards (etc) instead of stickers and destroying cards. This game can no longer be played once \"finished\" due to permanent modifications which is absolutely unacceptable. A game should be able to be re-played and/or shared amongst friends.

Even once you have the rules figured out for one month, it's difficult to remember what they are throughout the game because the so many things change from game to game (the rules don't change all that drastically, but they DO change strategy considerably, so even if the rule change isn't that huge, its importance usually is). The actual game seems okay at best, but it's not nearly good enough to make up for all the frustration of trying to figure out the rules. Other annoyances include:\n- It has a million little pieces that are hard to keep track of.\n- It's designed to only play through once (which is one or two games each for 12 \"months\").",

    "comment": "I would give it a five like the original pandemic but a $70 disposable game makes it a solid one. Plus what gives with the rankings. Its been on the market for six months and its rated higher than all but three games. A redone disposable game at that. Hmmm\n\nI've been questioned from a few people about me rating Pandemic Legacy I honestly just don't understand the justification of the game being number one. I am part of a big gaming community here in SE Michigan and granted it's not THE gaming mecca but its huge. Gaming is my number one hobby and I enjoy it immensely. I've played against thousands of different people throughout the years. What I am trying to say is that I think I can give an honest opinion about a game.\nNow about Pandemic Legacy: I've seen it played once and it looked OK. I asked what the players thought of it and they basically said that it was OK and the game was over-hyped. All three stores have it in stock and there were Christmas specials for the game, Up until now I used the BGG ranking system to try games out that I normally wouldn't try out normally. With the exception of Pandemic Legacy and the Star Wars/Descent game (I didn't care for Descent), I have the other eighteen games, with Netrunner probably being my favorite game. I haven't tried all eighteen yet but its close. Anyways, the biggest factor of what makes an elite game in my honest opinion is the \"fun factor\", but since what's fun to me might not be fun to other people it can't be measured accurately. So I measure games in other more objective ways. Every game with the exception of Caverna was a completely innovative ideal that sometimes even spawned a new type of game. Games like Twilight Struggles,which jump started the 21st century war-game, Terra Mystica, Agricola, Through the Ages, Castles of Burgundy ect bring much more to the table than Pandemic Legacy or Pandemic for that matter. Another factor is what other people want to play. I've been asked to play Warhammer 40k, Advanced Squad Leader, Panzer Grenadier, Combat Commander, Bolt Action, Magic, Splendor, Five Tribes, Dominion, Marvel Legendary, DC deck builder, Terra Mystica, Caverna, Castles of Burgandy, Castles of Mad King Ludwick, that fast food Magnate game and countless others over the past month by many different people. Not one person had Pandemic Legacy nor wanted to play it. That just doesn't seem right in my opinion. This game that is just an \"improvement\" over a game that is seldom played shouldn't even be close to number one let alone number one. It makes me question the integrity of the BGG rankings and from now on I'm not going to use it to help me decide what to purchase. Thank you for letting me rant. I know its a little long but sometimes I enjoy writing.\n\nIts been about six months, still haven't met anyone whose played it. I cannot give an honest opinion other than the game is so good it never hits the table. The local store that I frequent has several red and blue boxes for 20% off. Some number one game.\n\nWell when I write this it is April 15th 2017 and I still haven't seen the game played nor know anyone who played it. The game sits on the shelf at the store I frequent (both red and blue) I've seen TIME stories played at game stores occasionally and from what I read that is also a legacy game. I've also seen risk legacy and many RPG games played at stores. Again I just cannot understand how a game that is ranked the best never played.\n\nIts September 2017 and still haven't seen it played (exception briefly when it rolled out two years ago). I still don't know anyone who has played it. I just don't understand how it can be the number one game and nobody plays it. This is an exception of people should only rank games that are played as this is the only game I have ranked and not played.",

If you look at games like harry potter Hogwarts battle you can see there are other ways to package game box contents so that they are resealable. You can also direct people to put one time use contents back in the box after they are used instead of ripping them apart. The rules for later games are done on stickers that you stick in the instruction manual which in other games are done by a small sheet of paper and a slip pouch inside the manual. The game board also gets stickered up rendering it also useless for future games which every other game does by removable tokens. And when you actually do waste your money on this game you find out that, surprise it's just yet another zombie board game(when there are much better zombie games out there). This game is a cash grab and you are better off spending money on basically any other game.",

That's what I thought, then I actually go the game and boy was I wrong!\nThe game tells you to glue additional rules in the rule book. Okay that is bad enough on its own but oh no there is more, it tells you to put STICKERS on the BOARD! What!?! And that is not even the worst part, it tells you that once a character dies in the game you then rip up its profile card, that right there just breaks my board game morals.\nI mean what if you want to take it to a party and the group there and you want to play from the beginning? Also once you have played it you can't sell or trade it because changes are permanent! I think that they either should've sold it for less or given you at least 2 of everything. This game defies board game morals and it is a game that at most will last for 1-2 years then you got no more stickers. So it's a lose on the money, it's a lose on the fun, it's a lose on the board game morals, it's a lose on quantity AND it is a lose on lasting for a long time!\nMy advise, save your money and buy a different game, and if you have the game and it doesn't have permanent changes then trade it or sell it!",

This one actually REQUIRES to be played at least 12 times. And the story is very dry; we need to read the flavor text in order to feel the story. It does not work as a system at all.\n\nWhen a game based on its story needs the players to create a meta around its elements in order to keep the narrative alive, I think it just shows how weak its tie is to the story itself.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's Pandemic, but with more and more wrenches in its gear. The base game becomes harder, without necessarily offering more immersion.\n\nI have a feeling that this game is high in the bgg top because it was one of the first games that started the legacy trend, and either one of these:\n\na) players rate this game based on the good time they had with their pals, and not on the game itself;\nb) players rate this game high because they might not have enough experience to have a critical thought about this game and its flaws;\nc) I'm a grumpy douche who know nothing about boardgames, since this is the next best thing that happened in the gaming industry and I obviously missed the boat.",

    "comment": "If you have bad luck at the start of the campaign, your campaign is busted. The game mostly plays you, not the other way round. Rarely in my gaming career I had such a feeling of so little impact on the game course. Especially the high randomness in the starting situation bothers in a campaign that takes over all bad luck to the next session...\n\n*****\n\nIn a normal Pandemic session it does not hurt if the high amount of randomness destroys a game - you just reset and try again. The sessions are very short. But in this epic version every lost session carries over and has hard consequences for all the rest of the campaign. So if the huge random factors kill your session and result in a lot cities already in uprise, you have invested a lot of money in a game that will never make fun and that just plays you and not the other way round. Other than the normal Pandemic which is great here the randomness can kill a whole campaign. A pity.\n\n(Random factor means: starting by random with the wrong character; drawing the first three cities with 3 cubes each time again in the super virus zone; drawing later in the game always the same cities close to each other, so outbreaks kill the session without any chance for the group; the player cards always divide among the players without any chance to get a set; the needed action cards always coming at the end of the game; the first epidemic cards coming right in the first player turn AND resulting instantly in an outbreak...)\n\nOur campaign has been totally ruined by starting with simple bad draw luck and having the first three months always exactly drawn the same color we cannot treat with right at the start of the game session...\n\nAh, and by the way: Why always the same boring thematic background? It becomes annoying that even here you stumble upon... *spoiler alert ;-) *. Really, the designers had no other ideas than Captain Obvious?\n\n*****\n\nAND: The End is a huge letdown again. However you end the game - the end is soooo thin and thematically boring. A simple point scoring and then five options with each only one sentence? After 19 games played? Oh my... :-(",

    "comment": "Disclaimer: So far, our gaming group is only 3/4 in, we have to start playing October onward.\nMinor spoilers.\n\nWe picked up the game, decided to give a try to the legacy system. I was very excited to get into a constantly evolving story where your choices have an impact on further story line developments, etc.\n\nThe main caveat I've found in practice is ironically enough the Legacy aspect, the evolving story. While the plot evolves interestingly like a TV series season, the objectives also almost always remain the same. Thus to me, the supposed strength of the game is ultimately its weakness. On one side you got the plot progressing, but at the same time you got to cure and research the same diseases every game. Talk about repetitive goals.\nThat took down from the overall experience for me, and quite substantially as it was the main selling point. If I have completed a cure for a disease in January, and the plot doesn't mention anything requiring it to be researched once more, then why should I have to research a cure in all months hereafter? This paradox is difficult for me to get over in a game where story line and progression, and impact on future games is key.\n\nThe other aspects of the game worked for me, and most of it is well executed. I found the box openings to be a somewhat nice occasional adrenaline rush, albeit quite gimmicky, which I can't detail without entering into spoiler territory.\n\nOverall, kind of a let down in comparison to the love the game gets and what I expected in terms of experience. I understand that the Legacy concept was somewhat new and brought energy and changes with its play style, but my personal opinion is that it can be executed better as the concept grows. I fear an increasing amount of releases relying on the exact same concept execution without bettering it, akin to what Battle Royale has been in video games for the past year +.\n\nConclusion: Not entirely terrible, but for the cost, one-time usage, and somewhat sub-par storytelling and objectives evolution, I can't rate it very high.",

Je speelt kleine varianten van steeds hetzelfde spel, met dezelfde spelers en dat liefst in een vrij korte periode zodat de spelregels en gebeurtenissen nog fris in het geheugen zitten. De uitdaging is niet groot genoeg om te blijven boeien, vind ik. Wij faalden één keer omdat we de karakters niet kozen in functie van de doelen en één keer omdat we echt wel pech hadden bij het trekken van kaarten. Verder overwonnen we moeiteloos alle obstakels. Na een tijdje speelden we vrijwel op automatische piloot. Een sessie voorbereiden kostte ons op het eind meer tijd dan de sessie spelen. Ondanks de pogingen om te variëren, blijft Pandemic Legacy een herhaling van actie-kaartjes trekken-infecteren. Na een tijdje wat van het goede te veel.\n\n\nwould like to try but have doubts.\nI have a problem with pandemic and a problem with legacy.\n\nThe idea of a changing board is nice, but it assumes you have the time to play this, say, once a week. If you take it up after a month or so the tension is gone.\nThematically, curing viruses in time wins you in Pandemic. Then more viruses come, and you must cure them. And again ad nauseam. Until the board is ruined.\nLook if there was a way to capture the \"story\" that unfolded last time, I'd go for it in an instant, like \"Last time in your favorite series happened this:\" ...;\n\nYou would play this with good friends only, and when you are young. You can't play with people you meet at most frequent once a month; you can't play it with acquaintances. You might start it up with your loved one, but how will you react when your loved one tells you half way (s)he's no longer interested, or just plays along in the impression that you want him/her to.\n\nLastly, it's hard to translate to non english persons, the effect will be gone.

The first impression is that an awful lot of effort was spent on this \"legacy\" concept that adds nothing but component complexity to the game.\n\n* Game play on an individual scenario basis was good, with a nice variety of objectives and different situations.\n* Campaign elements were weak. Late in the game we had a hard time picking upgrades because there just wasn't anything useful to get.\n* Plot elements were awful. There are several that I not only can't stand in a game (or usually even in fiction), but they happen in rapid sequence. Probably the most ticked-off I've ever been at a boardgame.\n* Everything bad that happens is permanent and solid. Everything good is abstract and temporary. Even if you win every game, it feels like you are constantly losing. Never once had a feeling of success in the game.\n* Feels mostly like passive entertainment. All the important decisions and actions are made by the NPCs. We're just along for the ride and to \"watch\" the (truly lousy) plot.\n\n+co-op+",

There is no risk/reward in this game and once you are playing at an optimal level you are essentially watching the unfolding process of a game you are no longer capable of controlling. The legacy system is exciting and I look forward to the many ways games can benefit from this, but I do not believe Pandemic was a good pairing for it.",

It randomly hinders you or has no practical effects or sometimes even helps you... based on something you had no idea would have those consequences (so, as random as it can be). I suppose someone may like the \"surprise\" factor, but I find it the epitome of bad design as far as \"strategy\" goes.\n\nIt is easier than normal Pandemic (and much easier than Pandemic + Brink), so the only challenge is due to the occasional random screwage. Not a good feeling at all.\n\nThe narrative is short, banal and fails to add anythin to the experience.\n\nThe whole \"campaign\" idea is the core of any RPG and many videogames (and when you're done, one click on \"new game\" is enough... you don't have to rebuy it), so I do not get why it is praised so much (it is not common in boardgames because... it is a plainly bad idea for this medium).\n\nIt is expensive and \"play once\" (that single campaign lasts for as few as 12 games)... not exactly why I appreciate boardgames.",

If you fail a month, you are given a single second chance each month to re-do it.\n\nBut.. This game just does everything wrong for me.\nFirstly: It's a public knowledge co-op game, meaning your team is only as good as its dumbest player. Which for me translates to \"Oh it's a solitaire game! Like Forbidden Island, Xenoshyft, and XCOM.\"\n\nSecondly: It's non-replayable, similar to Risk Legacy but cranked up to 11. With Risk Legacy, the first 15 games shape the map, then you can just play on the completed map if you want. With this, once you've played the 2-24 required sessions (each roughly one hour) it's over, you're done, buy a new box if you want, but it'll be the same story.\n\nThird: It's $70.\n\nSo, if you really have a bad time, you can be that person who drops $70 to buy a non-replayable game, only to have to throw it out after 2 hours.\nIf you're a lucky or skilled person with a good team of enthusiastic players, you'll get about 16-18 hours of enjoyment out of it. For $70.\n\nThis could be the game for you after you divvy it up, (18 hours gameplay, $70 game, 4 players playing, roughly $1/hour per player for fun)\nbut it's not the game for me. Had I been the person to pay for it, it simply would have made me horribly depressed I just spent so much money only for it to be something non-permanent. Even worse so if a nice but slow-witted player ruined it for everyone by making it a 4-6 hour purchase that we never got to see the end of.\n\nThat's a good place for a closing note: It's a board game where if you don't beat it: either buy a new one and start over... cheat... or just pack it back up with that niggling doubt you'll never be able to complete it, because it's designed that way...",

    "comment": "Final comment on study of the game and conversations with the group (Status: Sleeved & resettable after initial campaign). No detailed spoilers, but ultra vague suggestions related to the structure of the campaign and ideas behind Legacy games follows:\n\nReally disappointing as a complete campaign. Instead, play Pandemic with expansions, or find a copy of the incredible Matt Leacock 'Thunderbirds' game plus expansions if you're fortunate enough to find a copy. That's the best way to reliably (and that is a key word in regards to this game) experience Pandemic. The campaign in Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 is not very good, and the experience of it feels empty and frought with thematic/gameplay tie issues that may not have been as apparent in 2015 among the universal praise for both the game and the still new Legacy format.\n\nPandemic Legacy: Season 1 is great fun for the first third of the in game year, then good but a little confused and awkwardly paced for the second third, and then actively boring and empty feeling for the last third, with additional mechanics and ideas which are simply dull, too easy to measure and respond to, and take away the focus from what made Pandemic a great board game.\n\nThe game is quite bad at introducing ideas and pacing itself, at least in my group's playthrough. This is very apparent during the final third of the campaign. I am a huge fan of Pandemic (my favourite being, erm, the amazing Thunderbirds game + expansions by Matt Leacock) and have played all of the expansions, but Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 just didn't land. We didn't play perfectly, but we're experienced enough to have not lost many games, with some of those being the curse of Pandemic Luck[TM]!!! with terrible set-up infection deck draws lining up with one another, and first/second turn Epidemic draws which almost immediately triggered off an impossible to cope with chain of outbreaks.\n\nThe lack of decent writing is understandable, and a prevalent issue with most Rob Daviau Legacy games, including the ones I really like. The story relies on tried and true tropes (not a criticism, archetypes and cliche can help in many stock narratives) and the game would be slowed down by too much narrative text, but the lack of thematic or gameplay flow when elements are introduced is slightly maddening and incredibly disappointing. That is before we started to realise how dull a lot of introduced ideas were, in both story and gameplay. I'm not against brevity or emergent storytelling, but I am when that emergent story may not happen for a group due to the board state/a generally well handled campaign. The lack of a backbone in the writing hurt the game from that point.\n\nThe destruction can hide some of this as not many games feature commitment via destructive, but I believe being a relatively big board game hobbyist shows up the flaws, cracks, and broadness that has to make up for the flaws and cracks. Seafall, Charterstone, Gloomhaven, Clank Legacy, and Risk Legacy are all better as full campaigns, even with their own distinct and varied flaws.\n\nThe ending of the Season 1 campaign is the worst I've seen in a Legacy game. Makes nothing you've done in the game matter in any regard. Truly a 'this is where it went? What happened to the commitment to theme or the things we spent so much time chasing or attempting? Why are we ending this like any other non-Legacy game?' It completely underwrites the point of a game that is meant to be played through once, and only once. It was so bad my group thought we were missing cards from the Legacy deck related to the final month. I had to search online to ensure this wasn't the case and was even more disappointed.\n\nI had already made most of the game resettable, but nearly half of the campaign felt pointless to the point of me not wanting to bother considering a replay in future. From hearing opinions of Season 2 and Season 0, it sounds like things improved massively in terms of tying theme to gameplay, and not abandoning that element at random.",

By the second half of the year through the end, the game becomes ridiculously fiddley. I love a lot of complex coop games like Spirit Island and Gloomhaven, so it's not that it was too complicated for us. It’s just that pandemic isn’t a good enough game to add this amount of rules and depth to. Despite the story line or added rules it was still always pandemic. Pandemic is fun to play casually, especially as a gateway game for others, but it’s not a good enough game to support this type of long term invested story line and rules complexity. It’s like trying to add a bunch of rules and complexity to Go-Fish, when you could just play a better more intricate game.

Legacy aspect is not as game altering as a I thought it would be so far. I expect gameplay will be much more affected as we continue on though an more cities begin to riot and more is revealed. So far the experience has been great and I look forward to getting it out for our weekly game night.\n\nUpdate through end of May. Rating dropped from 9 to 6. Pandemic really shines for it's simplicity in rules but complexity in managing the chaos. Unfortunately the continued additions to the game have weighed this game down significantly so that we are more worried about following all the new rules and managing all the new possible actions and less focused on having fun managing the diseases. We went from enthusiastically bringing this out to reluctantly continuing to play. We still plan to continue for now though.\n\nUpdate 11/2018: this has not seen the light of day in months. We just don't enjoy it anymore. Rating drops further.\n\nUpdate 8/2019: this game will never get played. No enthusiasm at all to pick it back up. It will probably go in the trash can.",

The difficulty increases faster when you win than it decreases when you lose, and if we keep playing, I'm fairly sure we'll be delving into that little black box labeled 8. And that's a MASSIVE if. This game is so stupid-hard that it's not even fun anymore and if we keep playing I'm going to end up divorced. Holy smokes don't play this game with people you actually care about.

Also it was a great game the first couple months and decent the second couple months. At that point the mechanics became so convoluted that it's impossible as a 2-player game. 3 characters are UTTERLY REQUIRED and 4 is absolutely the best. If playing 2-player, play 2 characters each.

However, since it is a coop, there is more opportunity for players to make legacy choices strategically, which I like -- in contrast to Risk Legacy, where players were expected to self balance the game but the incentive structure wasn't really there.\n\nRating based on watching people play full games.

That's fine, it's a relatively short game, and you could just play it again. In Pandemic Legacy, you can't play it again, and you're stuck with a permanently ruined board because the game sometimes throws out an impossible scenario.\n\nIf there are enough surprises in it then I think I would enjoy Risk Legacy.

Also, whether or not a game is won or lost is often determined by random effects; how hard or easy any given game is can be based upon factors outside of the control of the players, so to some extent, your decisions can simply not matter. You make the optimal play and hope randomness swings in your favor.

We realized too late how important roadblocks were, and with a bit of bad luck the game snowballed against us.\nWe are going to finish this game, but we are definately in the mood of \"Getting this over with\" instead of enjoying it.\nYou may say we are bad players and made bad decisions, but the game should be able to guide us back to a state where it is managable again. This is however not the case. Asia is gone and so are parts of north+south America.\nI consider this bad game design and not the fault of the players. We are barely able to set up the game for the coming months before the game destroys us. Getting 3 complete turns is neigh impossible.\n\nI'm getting more and more convinced of NOT getting season 2.",

To be fair, it's from 2015 and I began to play the game in 2025; 10 years in which the whole legacy mechanism developed a lot.\nAllthough some story ideas are interesting, the whole concept is strange, because you exterminate diseases, but in the next game they are back.\nOne of the biggest drawbacks were all of those rule questions, we invested a lot of time to search for specific rule clarifications.

To be honest, I was a bit over this game around the time of the June missions. By September I was starting to dread having to play it.\n\nWas it a fun experience? I enjoyed playing it with my gaming group. I didn't particularly enjoy the game. It was massively over hyped. It's hard to rate this game based on the BGG ratings. I will never play it again, and I rated it 4 because it did have enough interesting twists and turns along the way to get me through all 18 plays - but I was hating my life on the last 6 or so games.\n\nWe found it overwhelmingly difficult in some games and entirely too easy in others. It was so swingy for us. My group doesn't tend to like luck-heavy games and we started getting really down on the game when drawing 2 epidemics in a row (that happened several times). By the first game in December we just said \"ok, let's just play this back to back so we can get this over with.\"\n\nThis is my first experience with a legacy game and I'm not sure I would opt to do it again. I like campaign based games very much. I like the theory of things evolving between games. I'm not sure I like it in practice.\n\nOne thing I find particularly difficult, and probably the primary reason I will never play a legacy game again, is that you are pretty much required to play with the same group every time. If one person doesn't like the game you've pretty much just screwed up the entire experience for the entire time.

It's certainly fun, but it was exactly what I thought it would be. The game tends to evolve a bit adding expansion content later on which is nice. I do find this game is overall too easy, especially once you start to get some of the upgrades going. Making the virus easier to cure or easier to cure anywhere is a HUGE drop in difficulty if you can focus on that. Not to mention bringing in the scientist and keeping her alive. You only need 3 cards of a color anywhere at anytime. Once I had 2 of the 3 diseases with that, it became rather easy to cure just about anything.\n\nI can't say I enjoy this more than Pandemic and I think it comes down to a few things. The forced story/objectives made this frustrating at times. It was cool for a bit, but it just felt like a slog after a while. The constant addition of new rules/stickers/cards/opening boxes/opening dossiers/etc just became obnoxious. And just trying to get everyone back to the table again made this go from awesome to dead weight on my shelf. I just got to the point where I solo'd it just so I could grind through the last 6 months.\n\nI'm still not entirely sure how to rate this. A 1 is technically where it should be as I can't/won't play it again, but a more accurate assessment of the entire game is probably a better actual rating.\n\nWas it worth it? Ehh....maybe? I certainly got my moneys worth out of it, but I think this has now killed any legacy games for me. Which is probably a good thing in the end.",

    "comment": "I'm not finished with the full campaign yet, but so far it's so-so. I've played around ten games. I don't see why all the concern with spoilers yet. Maybe it's just having been more of a roleplayer, but there is barely a story. Granted it got my group to buy the game because we weren't able to watch a gameplay video since we were worried about \"spoiling\" it based on the reviews we'd seen saying it would be spoiled. Had we watched gameplay, we wouldn't have bought it based on the fact that it's pretty much the pandemic we already own. Another thing I don't understand is the need to make it disposable. I don't mind destroying components, this isn't about that. It's more that there have been campaign games since forever, and they all offer more change and story throughout play. This game offers basically the same thing from game to game, almost no story, but is a one-off play. Seems incredibly wasteful. I suppose I can recycle it when we're done\n\nUPDATE: We continue to trudge on, Our group is getting pretty tired of pandemic at this point even though we've been really spacing out the games since hitting the mid-way point. We're determined to complete it, but I think you need to love regular Pandemic or opening boxes to enjoy Pandemic Legacy. If you enjoy opening packs of cards for CCGs, this will probably scratch that same itch.\n\n2ND UPDATE: Still not done. We're down to our last few games, but we keep playing something else because while Pandemic isn't bad, it also isn't good. It's very mediocre and there are so many other actually good games that it's difficult to justify playing beyond for the sake of completion. I really don't get the worry about spoilers, there is practically no story in this. It's 12 sentences of story spread over 12+ games. I think I felt mislead into thinking it would be more than regular pandemic, but it's really not. It's the same pandemic experience with a couple modifiers that don't even do as much as some of the previous expansion material already released. Anyways, I'm dropping my rating from a 6.9 to a 5. I think my initial rating was built on hope of more interesting things coming out of the boxes but all I got was a variation on one of the most over-used tropes in all of board gaming.\n\n3RD UPDATE: We've finally finished this terrible game. I never want to play Pandemic again, dropping my rating to a 4.",

    "comment": "I appreciate Pandemic classic, and I felt fortunate that at the time (still in Grad school) I had a group that wanted to include me in their campaign of Legacy. I still feel kind of guilty about this, because this was an expensive gift from one member of the group to the other (his partner) and I think my losing interest kind of killed their momentum--I don't know if they ever finished without me. Let that be the first warning about engaging with this format--although swapping out players may not be ideal, it's not really emotionally fair to deny that as an option! Maybe have some kind of consent from everyone up front.\n\nMy ultimate souring on this game surprised me. The first two sessions were very exciting! It was only around session 3 or 4 that I realized it just wasn't going to happen.\n\nThe basic assumptions don't work for what I want. The game is trying to be a long-form, vaguely narrativist exercise at the campaign level, while being built of the original game's pass-fail semi-random puzzle solving at the episodic level. In order to maintain story momentum, the game will allow you to pass an episode after a certain number of failures--I can't remember if there's some kind of long-term \"penalty\" or what. On paper, this sounds like a good compromise. Keep the group from frustrating each other, and allow them \"officially\" to keep getting to the new story beats and the new toys and goodies to play with. But once we started losing, I hated it--I didn't want to move forward. It's not that I mind losing (I lose the vast majority of the time I play games!). It's that I lost any sense of what my play was supposed to mean, in the context of this game. In a narrativist RPG, either solo or with a good GM, you can meaningfully contribute to the shape of the narrative in the face of supposed mechanical \"failures\", since strategy or combat mechanics are not the only (or maybe even the primary!) meat of the experience. You are building a story collaboratively and flexibly, and those apparent failures can be integrated--the player might even get to make some interesting choices about how! In pandemic Legacy, the story is fine, but it's mostly a motivation for changing the game to the next successive variant in the scripted sequence of variants. In the context of a strategy boardgame, I want the addition of variants to change the meaning of the model or the way I engage with it in a way that requires a new form of mastery. I guess maybe P:L does that, but then the *fun* part of that, to me, is then having the opportunity to learn mastery over the new elements of the system, and reflect upon what that teaches me about the model. Wheras this design sort of hinges on the idea being that the fun part is getting to the next story beat and the next variant, irrespective of whether you gained fluency with the prior one. I dunno, maybe the story got really good later on, but where we were at it just wasn't enough of a reward to keep me from feeling pretty deflated.\n\nPart of what I've tried to figure out, in retrospect, is why this bummed me out so much. In the videogame space I've played shooters and so on where I really wanted to get to the next story beat, and turning things down to easy mode might even feel acceptable to achieve that. But here, in this context, it just felt like it was missing the point.",

    "comment": "About halfway through Season 1, I realized that I prefer base Pandemic. My opinion hasn't changed after completing Season 1.\n\nThere were some interesting ideas introduced in Season 1, but some of them restricted play. I find more dynamism in a single session of base Pandemic than a single session of Season 1. I'd have to play multiple seasons of Season 1 to experience the same feeling. I think this is because each game session in Season 1 sets up the next. There are some changes each month in Season 1, but generally the strategy is the same and there is a tactical shift. There's a certain focus that needs to be addressed on the board in Season 1 before game setup that won't be in play in basic Pandemic.\n\nThere were only a few things my friends and I were annoyed with. One was a mechanic introduced that was repeated four or five times. It was interesting the first time, but boring and uninspiring when repeated. This mechanic may have been repeated due to the designers wanting to adhere to the basic Pandemic system and not wanting to stray far from it. The other annoyance was a catch up mechanic introduced in the later months. I understand why it was built into the game, but it was irritating and negated some of the most boring sessions we played.\n\nI enjoyed how each session played out, but I was rather bored by the scripted story in between sessions.\n\nI probably will play Season 2 at some point, because I will play with friends. It was the main reason I finished Season 1, as well as wanting to see it through given my purchase of the game. I won't recommend for people to play this. There are better games and better campaign games, in my opinion.",

Not the immersive experience I was hoping for.\n\nEither a mediocre RPG session or an initially intriguing but soon very repetitive puzzle, depending on how you look at it.\n\nI can enjoy the occasional game of pandemic, but I don't like the game enough to play it over and over again, Legacy style. While the scope and the legacy mechanisms are interesting (even impressive), there are many games that I'd rather play over and over again, or several times a week, than this.\n\nMost likely we will not bother to continue playing, despite getting through half the game.\n\nUpdate: we didn't finish the game and that felt relieving.",

    "comment": "Overall this is a campaign adaption of the already great Pandemic base mechanisms. Unfortunately the campaign mostly consists of adding minor additional rules to pandemic, which does only make the game more convoluted, while you still play 90 % base pandemic.\nOn the one hand pandemic is a very well designed game and this game benefits from this. On the other hand the campaign adaption is pretty standard. Your characters gain special abilities, relationsships and permanent negative effects. Also you build stuff on the board and this and other stuff on the board can be destroyed. A negative aspect here is that the game is on purpose designed to be consumable, although this would not have been necessary. The special abilities, relationsships and scars could have been cards, which you add to the ziplock bag in which you store each character. The stuff you glue on the board, can be noted in a simple table. This lengthens set-up by about 1-2 minutes. Even the stickers you apply to the player cards, could be just put into the sleeve of the respective card.\nPersonally I also do not like, that this game is actually easier than base pandemic. It starts with only 5 epidemic cards and you mostly only need to cure three diseases, which makes the game maybe 60 % as difficult as base pandemic at the same epidemic card count. To counter this some mission like aspects get added to the game. These are sometimes fun, but overall not very imaginative and mostly it is only one kind of mission.\nOne other thing is the pretty boring story (Zombies and a conspiracy to gain world dominance).\nSo overall: Base pandemic is better, this has the usual problems of campaign games, which get amplified by the game being consumable and it is mostly just Pandemic plus minor rules additions.\nWould this be a normal replayable game, then it would be a 6/10, since you technically need to rebuy it, to play the campaign again I would be reluctant to play it again -> 4/10.",

It's still Pandemic, albeit significantly updated (and thus more fun). To be honest, I can't really fault Pandemic Legacy for being what it is; because it is a very good version of a game I sadly find to be rather stale - and that's also kind of the problem I have with it. That and obviously the price tag and no replayability. You might say it's good value-for-money to play at least 12 games of it, and while I agree and even like the idea of legacy games, I hate thinking about how I'll finish it and then it's...done. No finding the game at the bottom of your collection after years and getting excited about it again, no gifting or selling it when it's done; it just sounds wrong.\n\nWould rate it 8/10 as of now, most of it because of the fun we had being stupid and immature while naming things.\n\nUpdate: after winning the October game, more than a year passed without playing Pandemic Legacy getting any play. Not because there was no opportunity to play it but because nobody was really interested in continuing it.\n\nUpdate II: Haven't finished the game after 4 years, and if we ever do, it'll be more to get it out of the way than out of interest.

Part of the problem may be that we have too many versions of Pandemic, and there wasn't enough fresh material for me. I also wasn't a fan of the theme and story choices Legacy went with. It was intriguing to see how our gameplay changed when our choices became permanent, and the game did generate a fair amount of next-day discussion, but I feel like I can easily come up with one con for every pro (e.g. the sheer amount of garbage we produced while playing). In the end, I wish that I'd gotten two more Pandemic expansions instead, because now I'm left with a game I can't play. I think I just wanted Legacy to be more. I wanted the choices I made to radically alter the direction of my campaign (or at least have that potential), I wanted my story to be drastically different from anyone else's, I wanted to experience mechanics and scenarios I'd never imagined. But Pandemic Legacy really only had one possible story direction, and you were forced to stick to it. In the end, I enjoy playing Pandemic because winning feels like we *have* saved the world and averted catastrophe by curing disease. Pandemic Legacy didn't give me that feeling, even though it easily could have, and that's why I'm so sorely disappointed.",

The mystery really gets you going and having a new element of the game to pay attention to every now and then adds an interesting twist. I have one major problem with it though, which is that it rewards failure and punishes success (the number of event cards goes up if you lose and down if you win). The month-winning bonus counteracts this a bit but I absolutely hate when games do this. I get that it is basically a necessity to keep the game balanced but that doesn't mean I have to like it. A comparatively minor complaint is that as the rules get longer and longer you inevitably cheat for or against yourselves.

Each game makes the next easier or more difficult to win/lose, but the same thing happens regardless. It doesn't seem to matter if you win 12 in a row or lose 24 in a row. I would have liked to have seen more if/then changes along the lines of the \"if you lose 4 in a row, open box 8.\" Like \"3 fallen cities, open box 9.\" Maybe something like that is coming, but it doesn't look like it. It just doesn't seem like anything we do has any affect (besides making the next game slightly easier or harder). Maybe the last half of the game will change this impression.\n\nOn the other hand, if \"the game\" is the individual game you play that time, I can appreciate the whole box as an elaborate series of mini-expansions and mechanism for introducing them. Except you can't go back and play a version you liked a second time. This makes the little rule snafus very frustrating.\n\nUpdate: After the game sat on my shelf for another 6 months, my wife and I decided to \"play\" through the rest of the game by opening all the packets in order as if we had played and won each round. We didn't miss much. My initial assessment of the game being on rails stands.",

    "comment": "2016-10-13\nAs of this writing we are approximately halfway through the campaign. At this point I feel that the game is really about playing the same Pandemic scenario over and over again. The Legacy thing just adds new game mechanics and rules after every round. And the pace at which the game evolves is fast. At first the changes felt exciting and opening the boxes and dossiers was like Christmas. Now I already feel like I couldn't care less. There is a tsunami of rule breaking exceptions flooding out of every box and it is very difficult to maintain interest in learning all of them properly. Your choices do not seem to affect the future too much. In other words, there are apparent no one way doors that would really make you agonize over your decisions.\n\nThe game looks absolutely gorgeous though.\n\n2016-11-10\nWith three quarters of the game cleared I have to say that Pandemic Legacy achieves to do something many other co-ops do not. At least in our group there has been no single dominant alpha player. Instead the experience has truly been a co-operative one. Ironically this is due the fact nobody has been able to maintain interest in the events all the time.\n\nFinally the first ghosts from the past have started to emerge as your earlier decisions begin to have at least some accumulated effect on the outcome of a month. Moreover, the mystery behind the background story has started to unravel. In my opinion it is quite late for this story arc to develop as the early to mid-game is more or less predictable basic stuff.\n\nI still do not think this is a bad game and I definitely want to play this through. But at the same time I am eager to finish.\n\n2016-11-17\n4 months, 7 sessions, 19 games and 20-25 hours (depending on whether you include the time spent on setting up and cleaning). That is how long it took for us to finish the whole campaign. Was it worth it? Hard to say. The game had its moments but in the end, it was still the same Pandemic over and over again. My primary motivation to keep playing stemmed from Pandemic Legacy being the current No. 1 rated game on BGG and as a boardgame hobbyist I felt obliged to go through the experience myself.\n\nIn some games we had really really bad luck (the quickest defeat came in six turns) while in other games we felt invincible right from the start. So, the spectrum of luck in the game can be quite wide. We finished the game with a score of 541 points which I would guess to be close to the average. This is also in line with my gut feeling that we had average luck.\n\nThat being said, my final thought about the game is that our actions had little to no effect on the final outcome as our month-to-month success was mostly dictated by the luck of draw. Of course, the upgrades we chose during the game made the following months easier but still I did not once think that we had any kind of decisive edge over the fate that was shuffled into the two decks of cards. Perhaps the last two months were an exception when our highly debated decisions in November actually allowed us to win December in the nick of time.\n\nThe standard BGG rating system clearly does not work with legacy games. I do not have any desire to play Pandemic Legacy ever again because it is a one time experience. This would be in line with a rating of 3-4. However, at the same time the game works well because it has the same tested and proved Pandemic mechanics running under the hood. Thus the game should be rated a SIX. In the end, I think I am more inclined to rate Pandemic Legacy a FIVE. I did not find the legacy mechanic to enhance the game enough to justify a playing time of 25 hours. This is primarily because your decisions do not alter the course of the game enough and there is only one way to finish the campaign. At the moment, I'd rather play a 60min game of the original Pandemic than commit to playing Season 2 for another 25 hours. However, I fear the latter is inevitable...",

Also some of the character abilities need a little more description.\n\nI strongly recommend that you play a few runs of Vanilla Pandemic first so that the rules are fresh for all players. You will need your mental energy elsewhere! I also recommend that you play it through fairly rapidly. If you come back after a break it can be a little difficult to remember what the hell is going on.\n\nWe are at June now and I am losing interest a bit. It is still great but not as mind-blowing as I had hoped. Hopefully that will change when we open the next boxes!!\n\nYeah - June wasn't amazing.

A 2–4 player co-op campaign where you and your squad of specialists battle against four lethal diseases across an entire year of in-game time.\n\nHow do you win? Work together to complete each month’s objectives before the world spirals out of control. You’ll travel between cities, treat outbreaks, research cures, and build structures to give your team a fighting chance. Every player takes on a unique role scientist, medic, researcher, and more each with special powers that completely change your strategy. Also extras with DLCs and stuff cause this game been going on for like 10+ years I think XD\n\nBut here’s the thing: this isn’t just one game. Pandemic Legacy unfolds over 12–24 sessions depending on how well you do, with new rules, events, and components permanently added as you play. Stickers on the board? Yep. Characters gaining new skills or scars that haunt them forever? Definitely. Ripping up cards because your choices have consequences? Oh yeah. And if a character dies… they’re gone for good. Each month you’ll get two tries to succeed. Pull it off, and you march forward with your heads held high. Fail, and you get one more chance this time with extra funding for helpful events. But no matter what happens, the story pushes forward, and your world will never look the same.",

While this game had a strong start for our group, it's flaws have become pretty obvious sadly.\n\nThe \"legacy\" element of the game forces you into a win% of ~50% as you play through the game. Every time you win, the next game becomes more difficult, while losing a game makes the next game easier. The system is designed such that it is extremely hard for you to win twice in a row, and when you do, it usually happens after you've lost twice in a row. So you end up in this weird cycle where you know that in order to progress by winning, you will have to lose an almost equal amount. And that is frustrating. I feel like a co-op legacy game should give you the tools to win through every single scenario it throws at you on the first try, with an escalating difficulty as you progress. That is not what this game is. PL's idea of escalating difficulty is removing powerful action cards to increase randomness.\n\nThe extra rules that the game adds as the campaign goes on have also become a bit bloated and hard to keep track of. By comparison, TTR Legacy had extra rules/minigames but they all had an end timer and only stayed around for a few games.\n\n(Plays: 10+)",

Personally i wouldn't bother trying to reset it i'm turning mine into a shadow box display but i could easily see you turning this into a cool expanded version of base pandemic\n\ngame is at its core just base pandemic all the way through if you or anyone in your play group dislikes base pandemic they wont like this\n\nif your winning very well you only get about 12 games out of this rather than the 24 you get if you replay every month from failure\n\njust like with all legacy games it kind of feels like an obligation to play and you feel like you have to play it to completion rather than at your own leisure\n\nsome mechanics felt kind of gimicky we never really used them\n\n*minor spoiler in this point*\nif your winning very well you spend the whole game on \"funding level\" 0 meaning you get no event cards and you also never get to open and play with one of the boxes which really takes a lot of the spice out of the game.\n\noverall good game just not my favourite legacy game",

However, the nature of the game does not gel with my personality- being required to play several games of it in a short period of time makes me bored and frustrated at the same time. The problem is that the legacy features do not change the game substantially enough to feel like enough variety is happening. At the end of the day, you have to play the same game 12-24 times in a relatively short period of time.\n\nI find the legacy elements end up forcing the game to play you, to the extent where your choices don't have as much of an effect as it would have you believe. At the end of the day, you are on a linear path that follows the story of the legacy deck. It's like a co-op being run by a GM who takes into account our little decisions and shows us the little impacts that our choices make, but as a whole, is leading us down a story he/she has already created in it's entirety.",

Now, after completion, I am still convinced that it would have been possible to design the game in a way that you could play it multiple times. However, this is not my biggest concern. Instead, the storyline, while first being tense and interesting, became uninspired and destructive in the second half of the game. Additionally, I cannot understand one of the design decision on the storyline that essentially undermined the generally good idea of upgrading characters and fixing buildings on the map. That being said, Pandemic Legacy is still an interesting variant offering 12 to 24 sessions to play. Getting the original game and its expanions, however, still offers a greater variety of game modes, is more cost effective and, after all, more fun.",

Remember to carefully read and discuss every new rule two or three times with all players prior to each game. Otherwise you have either absolutely no challenge or destroy the world in one game to a degree, that you have no chance of winning the next rounds.\n2. You have to be extremely resistant to frustration for this game. Even if you are close to winning after two hours of careful planning, one unlucky draw of cards can leave you with only the question of how you want to lose.\nAnd every stage is more difficult than the previous one.\n\nSo only play this, if you think the normal pandemic is much to easy - even if you play without event cards.",

That was sufficient to convince me to play along till the end, but the overall campaign was too easy (there are developpement choices that are obviously better and we chose them).\nI add an overall good time, but any Special Pandemic (Iberia, Rise of tide, or Fall of Rome) is far, far better than this.",

And here's why:\n\n**Possible spoilers ahead, although nothing story related**\n\nI wasn't sure I would like the \"legacy\" system because I'm always very very careful with my games, always using sleeves & co. so the idea of permanently altering game components felt off to me. But I thought that in the interest of a changing story where my actions matter in the future games, I could overlook this thing.\n\nThe disappointment soon came when I realised that my actions don't really matter that much. The story moves along in the same direction no matter what I do. What actually matters is luck; we couldn't really strategise because the board can suffer major changes from one turn to the other based on card draw. So what happened was that we would more or less assign roles at the start of the game and do just that for the majority of the time (sometimes taking care of the new gimmick that was added). It felt more and more like we were programmed to do what we did.\n\nThe worst of all is that sometimes it felt like any planning we could do between each game to make our lives better, would later get punished. And to this regard, I am happy I unwillingly saw some spoilers that gave us the chance to adapt the plan and avoid something that would've ruined the experience completely for us.\n\nI don't mind losing. I'm playing a game therefor losing is not a surprise and I have my own coping mechanism to deal with a loss. But when this is unpreventable and it also makes life harder for all future games, it is so frustrating.\n\nEven so, I can see the potential in legacy games. I am definitely open to try more of them and see how the story unfolds. I will finish this story for sure and maybe I will even buy Season 2. Because there is something appealing to it. But I'm hoping there would be less of the things I don't like about Season 1 in Season 2.",

I've only played the first game yet (We played it wrong, drawing one of the legacy cards too late. The game would have been a bit different. It would have been easier to win if we had done it right. We won it anyway though).\nFirst: I don't like legacy games. I've tried a few by now. Every time I see one I think: \"Oooooo, THAT's cool!\", but every time I play one I think: \"I really prefer something that starts and finishes in one session\". This is just my personal taste.\nSecondy: The game is played fully open, with everything visible to everyone. This is really bad in cooperative games, because one player WILL become the alpha-player and control how everyone moves. It happens every time I play a cooperative game (unless each player has some individual element or objective that is \"secret\" from the other players). It's not fun at all. Not for anyone really, not even the alpha.\nBut otherwise this is an excellent game! Simpel rules that anyone can quickly understand. It's very well balanced, where the player decisions really affect the game in interesting ways. Do we need to handle those three black qubes in Delhi? Or should we concentrate to find the cure for red instead? Really fun!!!\nBut it cannot get a score higher than 6 or 7 unless the deficiencies mentioned above are \"fixed\". Maybe by some legacy rule I have yet to discover. Let's hope for that!",

Maybe someday I will try again and alter my comments and rating...\nThe second go-around offered a better experience. The group got off to a better start and the game flow reflected this fact.

I HATED having to replay months that we lost. Difficulty felt kind of artificial. Game ramps up difficulty and then hands you a new power. But it just didn't feel like very good design (I'm definitely in the minority on this opinion). It just became a frustrating exercise, felt like a chore. There was even a game in which a really cool story twist happened but in arrived in such a way that we were just about to win and then we lost. Ugh! I'm so surprised that I didn't enjoy it. Maybe our initially seeding of the board made it too tough. At this point almost all of yellow (our big, bad disease region) is impossible to access. We never finished the season and I kinda doubt we ever will. Maybe I'll finish it alone sometime.

    "comment": "Played January through end of September. The game is revolutionary and masterfully designed, with tight gameplay that offers an interesting and challenging co-op experience. The campaign gradually includes additional mechanics and complexity. However, the permanent changes to the board, characters, etc., which are probably the greatest appeal to many, to me just make the anxiety of playing often greater than the enjoyment: the fear of negative events, like a city collapsing or a character getting a scar, is amplified by the knowledge that these will affect all future plays. Frustration is quite possible, especially when the random setup makes the game (almost) unwinnable, but you still need to play through to the end in damage-control mode.\n\nWhile that point is a matter of preference, I think the game does have other weaknesses that make it feel overrated (how could it have been ranked no.1?!) (Thank you, Gloomhaven!). Most notably, the sense of immersion is much better realized in other games with beautiful components and illustrations (which are lacking here). Similarly, the campaign's story itself is not very engaging and is mostly driven by minimal paragraphs of flavor(less) text. While the secret components are intriguing at first, they end up feeling mostly underwhelming. E.g., I think only the April reveal was somewhat interesting in this way. I also find it hard to bring new players onboard in the middle of the campaign, especially with the fear of permanent consequences caused by learning-curve under-performance.\n\nI think other co-op campaign-based games with increasing complexity can offer better experiences, such as the amazing Legends of Andor (LoA). I still think the Legacy model has potential, but games like LoA make me question the need for locked content, permanent changes, self-imposed non-replayability, destruction of components, etc.",

When the f is season 2?\n\nEdit: And we never played it again after \"May\". Every gamer I know has started it, all have liked or loved it, none have finished it. Every once in a while we open the box, realize what it would take to get back into it, and close it again. If you don't have a dedicated game table where you can leave a game out for a month or two, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nEdit: Finally finished, solo. By the end it was a chore. Also, I guess I lost by forfeit. I got a new rule wrong on my last two plays and made the game way too easy on myself. Of course there's no way to backtrack or to correct my mistake. So, after all that effort, it's over, it wasn't particularly fun, and there is little to no sense of accomplishment. The only satisfaction is mostly just relief that it’s over.\n\nI've heard friends say they have had the same problem. It is very, very difficult to keep the rules straight in a familiar game when they are changing every time you play.\n\nI still have to give it a solid 7, although the fact that I would NEVER play it again, even if the opportunity presented itself, suggests a lower score ld be appropriate. (Does that mean it wasThereare good movies you would never want to see again...)\n\nBottom line for me, if you're new to gaming and don't have a lot of games you love to play, this may be a great experience. But if you have more great games you're dying to get to the table than you can actually play, like me, PL may prove a distraction, a nuisance and ultimately a letdown.",

(2) It scaled better. Original Pandemic scales decently - it's not perfect, but those Event Cards do help ease the difficulty somewhat for a 4-or-5-player game (not so much in Original as much as in On the Brink). This game just takes away that huge advantage. It got to the point to where we were losing via the Outbreak track by the 3rd Epidemic. EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. That says to me that they didn't play-test the game enough. And I have always said that Pandemic feels like a game that they play-tested A LOT because so many games go down right to the wire. We rarely saw the wire in the last half of Season 1. The game promised a deeper story and stronger characters, but neither feels any deeper or stronger than in the original game. So, really, the whole thing just comes off as Pandemic: Now with Even More Rules! Pandemic has too many rules already. It certainly didn't need more! Had we played with just 2 characters, like so many others seem to have done, maybe we would have liked it more. With 4 characters, August through November were absolute chores. A game shouldn't be a chore.",

Although the game surprised me here and there, it is still lacks the big punches. I suspect that that it's more related with my previous experience with legacy games than the game's fault. I can understand the fascination that the games exerted in the board game community being the first of its kind.\n\nUpdate: We are now in October. Some plot twists, but intrinsically, the core game remains the same. Although we intend to finish the campaign, I don't think I'll ever play any Pandemic game after this.

Actually it was surprising but we fulfilled one goal on first turn. Narrative from September to October is moving forward eventually and pretty fast but not deep. Looking forward to end the game finally this week. Overall - positive emotions but much overhyped, cannot believe that it is still so high in ratings. For me it would be better game if the game contained only 6 scenarios, not 12.\nFinally done last two scenarios. New mechanic is making game more challenging which was definitely just in time. However the narrative, maaaaan. It sucks=(\nFelt so underwhelming after the whole job done. Why why why…\nEnd score 6.5/10",

Haven't played with any expansions yet even though I own On The Brink. Legacy takes it in a whole different direction from what I was used to without making it so convoluted that it would drive me away. We are at April and I am always looking forward to the next play session.\n\nThis is a tough one to rate. It is a really great experience and deserves a high rating but when you throw in the replay-ability factor it will ultimately have to take a hit because i don't see breaking this out year after year (actually instead of \"breaking it out\" you would have to purchase it and play a fresh copy)consistently because once you start a \"game\", you are committed to at least 18 sessions to play it through. So, giving it a 10 seems wrong based on the accepted rating system. Yes, it is a game I want to play at every chance, but only until it is completed. Afterwards, I don't see having that same feeling about it. So it has to be rated lower.\n\n(update) Getting towards the end and the game experience is really starting to drag on. The story is still engaging but playing virtually the same game 14 straight times is tiresome. As well, there are a bunch of components (characters and items) that got opened along the way that aren't getting utilized and probably won't before finishing. The lack of replay-ability means that these components will never be used; there will never be an opportunity to see how playing those characters in different combinations would affect game play.\n\nFinished in 17 games. Finished with a win. 693 points.",

The way the game is constantly changing and giving new objectives, and there's a true story that unfolds throughout the game is super cool.\n\nHowever, I also had frustrations with it, for a variety of reasons:\n- Some aspects of the game didn't seem that balanced. Certain characters with certain upgrades seem very very strong, while other characters or actions seem obviously less useful. This is pretty consistent throughout the months.\n- Game is far far harder with 4 players than with 2. I wish this was balanced somehow.\n- While in some ways, the game gets easier if you lose (game end upgrades, increased funding level, eventually vaccinations), in other ways it gets harder (more panicking cities; more scarred or lost characters). In my view, the rubber-banding is off, and on the net the game will be harder the next go after a loss, at least for most of the months. I found this frustrating.\n- Sometimes cities can erupt immediately the same turn as you flip a pandemic; this can feel super unfair as you don't even have a single turn to react.\n\nBut, I think this is a fun and cool game nonetheless.",

Het verhaal vind ik echter wat mager. Ik snap niet dat dit seizoen hoger staat dan die die erna komen, behalve dan misschien dat deze veel meer gespeeld is geweest. Ik hoop dat velen zich door deze pandemic niet laten afschrikken om de volgende te spelen want die worden wel beter.\n\nHuisregel hier maak ik wel bij pandemic als ik een epidemie kaart trek en ik moet er 1 van onder de stapel trekken, dat die kaart niet meteen terug tevoorschijn komt om te infecteren, gezien je hier echt niks aan kan veranderen als dit op komt.

    "comment": "What a great legacy game- immediately enjoying how the system can be slightly changed to change how you interact with the game. The first twist completely sent us a different direction and shook up our strategy. The entire group feels like we are in this battle together and are trying to overcome an evolving game state.\n\nEach round there are new objectives, revelations, and changes that make you reconsider your approach to the game. Opening the boxes is exciting, similar to an advent calendar. You have an idea of what will be inside, but still fun to reveal. After each game, you also get permanent game upgrades and power upgrades. There are also permanent penalties that remain in force throughout the game.\n\nThe hard thing with pandemic is quarterbacking. Hard not to tell someone the best strategy is- you hope they can come up with it, but at times, you need to weigh in. But, when people are vocal and ideas are debated, it’s great to come to the best solution, especially one you hadn’t considered. Especially when it’s a game-winning revelation. Specific player powers also limits quarterbacking.\n\nPandemic is also extra challenging when you get a bad draw during an epidemic that can spiral out of control quickly. However, most games feel tight, like we barely eked out a win.\n\nAnd for the first time of masking while playing a game, it actually felt thematically appropriate.\n\nNever finished the campaign. Later scenarios started feeling too similar to previous scenarios, unfortunately. Great early promise that fizzled out in our group.",

I found ways using the in-game mechanics to overcome a lot of my peeves with Pandemic's rules and systems, which was nice. The Funding Level governing how many event cards you get isn't thematic or fun.\n\nThis is an iconic and historically important game, but I think time would be better spent playing more modern Legacy/Campaign style games unless you absolutely love Pandemic.

    "comment": "This one is hard to rate. I played 3-handed solo. It was my first legacy game to play all the way through. I love the Pandemic system, I usually play solo, and I rate all of the regular games in that system an 8 or higher.\n\nIt is very much Pandemic, with some story added and mechanics progressively added over the course of the campaign (19 games, for me).\n\nOne way it felt very different from the other pandemics (for me) is the degree to which I felt I had to engage with the puzzle of choosing what characters to pair together. Typically with the pandemic games, though, I do a completely random role selection or, for the IP games, I might do one based on thematics, depending on my mood. I *never* pick and choose roles for synergies. And there are definitely games I lost and objectives I missed because of the choices I made there.\n\nThe story was uninspired but not wholly uninteresting. The lack of branching narratives started to feel like a weakness by the time I was 2/3 through the campaign, and the mechanical corrective for that** leaves me really surprised there aren’t more comments on it.\n\nKnowing this game came out before any of the spin off games, it was interesting to see some influence on the later games. The final objective, in particular, was picked up and used extensively (and, frankly, better) in one of the spin-offs that came out after all the pandemic legacy games.\n\nVanilla Pandemic is swingier than most of its successors, and I think this one had points where it felt swingier than vanilla Pandemic.\n\nI disliked that the map you start with for early January is flatter than the vanilla Pandemic map, but I loved how the map’s texture shifted after, and even during, each game. As far as I could see, that was the only thing that justified this being a legacy, one-time-through, campaign. None of the other changes are so big or frequent they couldn’t be handled through tokens, cards, &c. instead of stickers. Also, speaking of components and their necessity, scratch-offs suck.\n\n**SPOILER\nNot a story spoiler, really, but a mechanical one: the whole thing ends with a BYOS-style score chart?!? Really?!? It makes the choices you make matter, but also would skew incentives if it were known before the end. I completed all but one of the search objectives, but the one I’d didn’t complete was super unlucky for me and would have required such singular focus to complete I for sure would have lost the games it was in trying to complete it (and still might not have been able to). Not getting that objective meant -100 points for me, and I might as well have not bothered with the other search objectives, as they gained me nothing without having completed all of them. I also was denied 80 points because I left one of the things for those points untouched (because it was on a level 5 city), and got no credit for dealing with all of the others (though at least dealing with them made one of the final objectives easier, so it wasn’t useless the way the search objectives were).\n\nI enjoyed the journey, even if the destination left me a little cold. The BYOS chart I dislike (there are some games I enjoy solo despite being BYOS, but not many) and the final two objectives for December were meh for me. December was actually the least interesting of the twelve months, I thought. I like Pandemic a lot, and I’m glad I played through this, and maybe I’ll even do seasons 2 and 0 but, owning all of the regular Pandemic games (as I do), I didn’t feel this to be an especially unique or interesting take on it (although I appreciate that that may have been different in 2015 compared with 2025). And, after 19 games played over less than two weeks, it is done and can never be pulled out again. That is a knock against it. I own plenty of games I haven’t played 20 times, or for a total of 20-25 hours. But the fact that this was one officially done, forever, and unable to be passed on or re-sold, doesn’t feel great. Especially since it didn’t wow me.",

    "comment": "I'll update this after each session, with final comments upon completion of the campaign.\n\nOur second session was a rather difficult one... we lost 3 games in a row (both in May and first game of June) before finally winning one.\n\nCan't say too much without including spoilers but suffice it to say that this is definitely better than base Pandemic. The game and tension intensify as you progress throughout the year and the legacy mechanic continues to hold my interest (what is on those stickers? What is in those packets?). Designers have done a very good job coming up with variants that pose tough choices and keep you engaged. I've now played 10 games of Pandemic Legacy in the last 2 weeks and I find it unlikely I would have played 10 games of base Pandemic in the next 5 years.\n\nSome early critiques:\n\n- I expected more narrative as everything is scripted from month to month, however, all we get is a sentence or two per legacy card. Certainly we have moments during the plays and a general escalation and progression is there, but I would prefer a little more explicit story as opposed to letting the players fill in the blanks. Perhaps my expectations were too high coming in as a result of all the hyped reviews stating this feels like you're in a movie... haven't felt that yet, but this certainly has more story than your average game.\n\n- The mechanics evolve over the time but the actual game play still feels much like base Pandemic. Once you get over the excitement of reading the legacy cards and opening packets, it doesn't take very long before you get a samey feeling; most likely because the core actions (e.g. cure), infect step, epidemics, etc. remain in tact.. perhaps that will change before the end of the campaign.\n\n- I haven't seen anything terribly innovative YET, but we still have 6 months to play. The Legacy system has been done before, some of the variants are in existing expansions and others are somewhat obvious. Still waiting for something that will fundamentally change the feel of the actual game play.\n\n- The campaign is a bit long. I normally get 2 game nights a month, and if we continue at our current pace, this will take up to 2 months of my gaming in 2016. While I'm enjoying my experience, there are many other games I would like to play.\n\n- This is a shared goal, open information, cooperative game, which is not my favorite type of game. I find these type of games to be OK, but not something I would typically rate higher than a 7 or so.\n\nPandemic Legacy is tough to rate as the BGG rating system wasn't designed for this type of game. After my first session, I rated this a 7.5 and this session hasn't done anything to improve upon that, in fact, I may move this down to a 7, which is the absolute floor as this is strictly better than base Pandemic which I rate a 6.5. I'm still having fun after 2 sessions but am ready to take a break and get back to playing other (non-cooperative) games in our group's collection, picking this back up in a month or so. I think this has the potential to move up, but only if I see something that significantly changes the game play or more of an explicit narrative with unforeseen twists.",

The difficulty of the game ratchets up as the legacy/campaign aspect progresses, and additional rules / concepts are introduced. This thematically improves the game even more, but does run the risk that it could become easy (especially for a solo player) to miss a rule or two. Unlike say Clank! Legacy, Pandemic Legacy's final board / rules doesn't easily allow you to restart the game and/or continuing onwards without a lot of (unneeded early) information being visible or left over from the mid- to late-game. So while this is a Legacy game, I feel like it is more of a one-shot legacy than some other legacy games. But regardless, this is a very well-designed and thematic game that really ramps up the tension, in a straightforward way.\n\nhowever, once the game progresses (and more rules start being applied) it may get more awkward for solo player to not have another set of eyes on things.",

The rules are quite simple at the beginning of the game, but become numerous at the end of the game; and it is very easy to forget some of them unintentionally.\nTo win the last month, you only need luck.\nVery good times spent! I recommend it for those who haven't played it yet (Be careful, it will certainly bring back memories of Covid XD)",

But mostly because your friends are likely fun to be around.\n\nWe had the most fun telling our own stories joking about character names we made up ect. Most of that wasn't brought by the game which is a bummer... but i gotta giveit credit for putting us in a positionto have fun with eachother.\n\nAfter 14 games i dont feel like i ever need to play pandemic again... it was fun but moat games you could tell if you were going to win about half way through.\n\nPersonally thought it was just a little to easy.",

One problem I have with the pandemic series, however, is that it is very easy for one player to sort of steamroll the decision making process in the game, which kind of makes everyone else sort of feel like they're along for the ride. With all the cool whistles and bells in this game, it still doesn't manage to address that problem. Regardless, it's still fun.",

Perhaps it's just the novelty of the stickers and the new rules, but there were so many fun surprises, each month felt like something new (aside from some of the middle months, where it felt like there wasn't tons of innovation). The story was great, the gameplay deep enough that there wasn't always a clear path to victory (or rather, victory could be defined by multiple different metrics) so quarterbacking much lessened.

But very quickly, the Legacy system changes everything. Each game leaves a mark, on the board, on the rules, on the players themselves.\n\nWhat starts as a routine mission turns into a dramatic story you build together full of highs.\n\nThe real tension doesn’t just come from fighting outbreaks but from the knowledge that every choice has lasting consequences. We won together but we also lose together. And sometimes we argue passionately about what’s “best for the team”\n\nLike most co-op games it can suffer from quarterbacking (when one player tries to direct everyone) but with the right group, open-minded and equally engaged sure it becomes unforgettable.\n\nWhen the campaign ends, you’re left with a strange mix of pride, nostalgia, and loss… as if you’ve just closed a great novel written by your own group of friends.",

You can play one full campaign of 12 to 24 games and then you're done with this game (you can no longer play it with the full Legacy experience).\n-- On the point above, I would have like that the designers would include a sealed envelope that would have official variants to play the game using your own unique board afterward (to mitigate the one time use aspect).\n-- This is a lower value game (strictly speaking, because of the lack of replayability of the Legacy campaign), but still a great value gaming experience.\n-- (Not a concern for me, but an important recommandation) This game should always be played with the same people and individual games should be played relatively close together (ideally at least a game every week, max every two weeks) to keep the additional rules fresh in your memory.\n-- Like many legacy games, the play time is longer than written on the box, especially on certain months.\n\n\n OTHER GAME INFO:\n\nGame Weight = 2.8/5\nRelease Date = 2015\nNumber of Player = (1)2-4\n2-player length = 45-60 min (playtime) + 15-30 min.

Perhaps my view is inflated by the fact that this is the first game of it's kind I've played.

    "comment": "The Pandemic Legacy games are still the best legacy games there are. It's amazing they came out so early and nailed it. I love regular Pandemic and the legacy version is even better. Even though Pandemic has the risk that a bad starting shuffle could wreck a game. Its strength is that you need to be clever to do well, and switch up your strategies as the game changes, which it does in big ways despite always following the basics of Pandemic. Your decisions feel incredibly meaningful. The fact that it is fully cooperative really helps. A lot of legacy games that aren't fully cooperative have to make changes that aren't so meaningful to avoid throwing off the balance of the game, or they do throw off the balance of the game and aren't fun to play as a campaign. Without giving much away, as you play Pandemic Legacy, you will get lots of new cards, goals, rules stickers, characters, and other game components. There are 12 missions, and you get 2 chances to beat each. There is a deck of cards you progress through with each mission, win or lose. There are dossiers panels to open containing stickers. You will be putting stickers all over the rules, board, and cards, forever changing them. There are boxes to open during certain triggers, giving you bigger components. And after each game, win or lose, you can make choices to upgrade different things, making your team stronger. The game will tell you to destroy components, but I just saved \"destroyed\" components in a separate bag as mementos. This game is a one time play through, but the game is so good that it is still worth it even though it's pricey. That said, if you don't like puzzles or don't quickly adjust to change, this game is probably not for you. If you do well, the rewards will compound. If you do poorly, you get some help, but probably not enough to make the game fun for you. And if characters die, you might get a lot weaker. Also, the game is cooperative and you will need to make decisions as a group. For me, the game is fantastic, one of the best ever, but I can see how playing it with the wrong group could ruin it. Because the game is so unique and uses stickers, it's very important to read things carefully, and you will need to look up some rules clarifications online or just make judgement calls as a group. If you make a mistake, it can be impossible to reset from it. These are not reusable stickers, and they don't peel off. But you can punish or aid yourself to make up for mistakes, but agreeing on what is a fair correction is a challenge. We did screw up one big thing and caught it after a game, and then punished ourselves even harder for it. Just make sure multiple players are reading the rules and keeping an eye out for mistakes. Double and triple checking before placing stickers. The game quality is great, but it can be difficult to write on the character sheets. Some pens work better on them than others. It can be tricky to peel the stickers from their backings too, and lay them down straight. It's not for the obsessive compulsive. So far, I have played season 1 and 2. Season 1 is my favorite. The theme & gameplay is great in both. Though the artwork is better in season 2, especially the character art which is more customizable, in a post apocalyptic theme where you start on floating cities in the ocean and must discover the map as the season goes. Season 1 has the traditional Pandemic look, with the full map revealed from the start. But I felt like season 1 ended really well, taking into account your overall progress to give you a final score that was more meaningful, while season 2 pinned all your success on a final gauntlet. Season 2 had more randomness because you had to make decisions without knowing what was hidden in the map. We put off going to some places thinking we were doing ourselves a favor, but instead ended up hurting ourselves considerably. But both are great games and you could start with either. Note that season 1 and 2 come in 2 box colors each. There is no difference to the gameplay in the 2 colors. It is basically so you can play 2 campaigns simultaneously and tell them apart.",

Las mecánicas son una evolución de la versión básica con nuevos añadidos según avanza la historia que consiguen que las partidas no se vuelvan repetitivas.\nPara darle algo más de dificultad al juego, jugamos dos jugadores manejando dos personajes cada uno (manejando uno cada uno disminuye mucho la dificultad).\nEl inicio es muy sorprendente aunque con el avance del juego esto decae un poco, pero aún así es una experiencia más que recomendable (siempre que te guste Pandemic). En definitiva, no me arrepiento de haberlo jugado.\n¿Jugaré la temporada 2? Posiblemente si, si encuentro un grupo para ello.\n---\n[15/02/2018] Sale de la colección --> Cedido a Óliver",

I am extremely happy that she did.\n\nI am a big regular Pandemic fan, but this turns it up to 11 as Nigel Tufnell would say. There is so much tension, and the feeling of surprise is astounding. The game is unpredictable but you feel like early choices could have a big effect in later months.\n\nThe game weaves a story - it's like watching a movie in some respects.

The game itself is getting nuts, every round brings more and more ridiculous stuff to the table. Can’t wait to dive deeper.\n\nFinal Update: We finished it, took us about 6-7 months but we did it. Of the legacy campaigns we have played it has been by and far the absolute best, it was so tense and brutal, and we won some games by the skin of our teeth, but overall it was so much fun.
