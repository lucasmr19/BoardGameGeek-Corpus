The deckbuilding has some avoidable lows, but very few highs. It's not as interesting as Quest for El Dorado, you're just doing busywork to manage all these sub-phases with weird order and variables. Unless you're slipstreaming, then you mindlessly move forward automatically... bypassing many of the restrictions, which means even MORE rules to learn! And if you're way behind, you get little bonuses to help you catch up, but that means even more rules that are easily forgettable. You might as well be rolling dice and getting it over with faster.... oh wait, that's Formula D.\n\nWhy not just play Mario Kart?",

But the more I play, the more I have distanced myself from it and found that I was enjoying it less and less. Not as much strategic depth as there originally seemed, and while I understand that it's supposed to be a 'tactical' game first and foremost, even there it seems a bit lacking in terms of satisfying decision space. You will generally fall victim to luck of the draw, and based on your hand at any given moment, the choice(s) you should be making seem fairly obvious, almost autonomous. Sure, there is the occasional decision of 'should I push my luck with this Stress card to advance a little further' but even then, those choices tend to become more transparent the more you play. I'll never turn down a game, but I'm no longer actively seeking them out, either.",

    "comment": "One of the most overrated board games to date, good god. There is barely a game in this. The game's a double whammy:\n\n1. Your choices are very obvious\n2. Your choices does not matter (at least until the last 2-3 rounds of the game).\n\nThe game felt a lot more like a first grade math's class than an actual racing game. It's very obvious what to do and how to do it. The only way you screw up or have challenges in this game is if you close your eyes for the whole game or you get bad draws. You could try all you want to take risks, but just know that they almost never gets rewarded. The game is only meant to be played a certain way, any attempt to play outside of this very shallow, linear space will not be rewarded.\n\nIf you are ahead, you get sucked back to the middle. If you are behind, you get pushed back to the middle. Whatever you do does not matter until the last 2-3 rounds of the game, where if you got good high numbered cards, you'll probably win. The game feels like it's trying to fool you into thinking that you're making decisions by changing gears, playing cards and whatever, but in reality you're just playing adult candy land. Edit: I finally understand why they put so much catchup mechanic. This is because if you are behind by 1-2 corners, you almost cannot catch up at all. How can a game with a lot of catchup mechanic still have a catchup problem? lol\n\nThe above is 100% true for base game. Base game + upgrade cards is a bit more flavorful, but still suffers from the same kind of repetitive, uininteresting BS. If you got the right combination of upgrade cards, you might be lucky enough to be able to cross two corners at the same turn in any map (best thing you could do in game), but then at that point you should ask yourself if the initial draft determines the winner, because not all upgrade cards enable you to do that.\n\nAvoid if you like to actually make good decisions in your game. Why this game is popular is BEYOND me. This would make a perfect kids game though. Also, stop calling this a deck builder people, it's not one.\n--see my video review for full breakdown--",

Far too light and random - once again proving hype can convince many people that they are playing a good game.\n\nAs someone else commented, the game itself has shallow decision making (pretty much boils down to \"slow down before curves, speed up on straights, hope for good draws\") and lacks any excitement or interaction that others claim is available. And the wee cars themselves are an awful production issue - nasty is the word I would use for them - they should have been much nicer to use.\n\nFrom the 6 max (on the board) not being underlined (I thought it was a 9) to poor colour choice for inside lane there are so many niggles that spoilt this game for me, including the two automated cars in the game I played. For example, even with a hand of 7 cards, the luck is enormous - you slow down in a corner but if you don't have any heat cards in hand that you can discard from hand, well too bad.\n\nI would sell it but it is so poor I would not wish the game on any one else!",

Too many fiddly rules and exceptions with symbology that's easy to overlook at first, you have a 7 step turn structure in a light racing game, its bloated and inelegant.\n\nThe card management system whilst somewhat similar, does also seem inferior to Flamme Rouge. So I kinda wonder why even bother with it.\n\nHype seems to have come and gone on this one and can't see myself ever playing it again, although I certainly wouldn't refuse, it's a decent enough experience.\n\nI do also wonder if playing with some of the extras in the box might improve it as well, but I'll likely never try them.",

    "comment": "This game probably has the worst components I’ve ever seen. For the price it costs, it’s embarrassing. In short, you get 12 pieces made of very fragile plastic and the rest are cards of extremely poor quality. The thing that made me angriest is the player boards, which are printed on non-rigid paper sheets, as if they tore pages out of a notebook and stuck a print on them. Anyone who says this game has good components clearly has neither eyes nor touch.\n\nBut let’s talk about the game. In short, it’s like **The Goose Game** with less interaction. The gameplay revolves entirely around managing your cards and engine, essentially going fast on straights and slow on corners. It’s interesting; you can do some neat things, especially in the advanced version, but there’s one huge problem: you play alone the whole time. There’s zero interaction with other players, which is ridiculous for a car racing game.\n\nYou can’t calculate or predict where others will move, so it becomes a random mess. And where’s the problem, you ask? The issue lies in the mechanics and the upgrade cards. The game has a drafting mechanic—if you end your movement behind or next to another player, you can draft and move one or two spaces ahead. That’s interesting, but since the game is such a random mess, this mechanic is entirely luck-based. This impacts the game and the cards that give bonus movement for drafting (both advanced and on the main board), making them useless or the worst cards to pick.\n\nThe main issue is the simultaneous phases. When choosing your gear, it lets you play a set number of movement cards, but first, all players cover their choices, then reveal them one by one in turn. This is the game’s biggest flaw. It’s not fun to have no idea where others are going or to be unable to use a mechanic effectively. Perhaps playing turns individually would significantly improve the game, allowing players to better manage their movements.\n\nIt’s really a shame. This “family” game has a competitive mode that’s even dumber and more random than the normal one. You still cover your cards and set the gear afterward. It makes no sense.\n\nTo conclude, if you like playing alone, just play **Wingspan**—it’s more fun.",

Dropping back to first gear is bad enough but having a deck of Heat cards aswell makes it an excessive penalty. So just don’t Spin Out then?

Randomly drawn number cards to determine your speed and being forced to play X number of cards is bad game mechanics. A player should have all the cards at their disposal to make their movement for that turn or give a base speed for each gear and then the cards are extra. Drivers normally know the track, know the turns, they know when to shift and what speed or RPMs their car can provide/handle. The game also has it setup where you have heat in your engine and you spend heat to do things that are either bonuses or extras. This process should be reversed, it should also be based on RPMs on how you shift/when you go into the turn. However, no matter how much I dislike this game design and would never want to purchased the game, the visuals are good. They offer multiple tracks, they have clear instructions (which the game is fairly easy to pick up on), the game is quick to play too, the maps various on the number of rounds it takes to finish.

There are more than enough ways to cool, but you can't find your heat cards therefore can't cool (thematic fail!!). Only 6 heat cards seem not enough and some scenarios and weather conditions even reduce it further. There is not much managing your heat if your heat cards are lost and hidden in your deck and you never draw more than one. It also takes way too long to get through your deck in order to be able to draw heat cards at the beginning of every race.\n\nThe gear shifting works ok, but also quite unthematic even when you think of it as \"shifting up towards the gear over this round\" because you can be in gear 4 and play 3x1 and a 2 or you can be in gear 1 and play a 6.\n\nSome upgrade cards are a trap while others are insanely good.\nThe sponsor cards are very good and introduce a good bit of luck. At least they change up how everybody drives and probably serve an important purpose in the first race of a Grand Prix when players have only few upgrade cards in their decks. But it's weird when your spoiler wing or something like that works only once and then goes away (thematic fail!).\n\nThe 4 racing tracks could be better and should have more variety.\nThe changing conditions (weather, region tiles) are nice.\nPlaying a full Grand Prix is fairly good, but takes several hours. Not sure yet how diverse the Grand Prix scenario cards are. I would not touch the game for a single race or for playing without upgrade cards.\nThe starting decks should have a bit more to them. Even with 6 upgrade cards in the last race of a Grand Prix you often have boring turns where you just play basic cards and suck at managing a tight curve. I might even house rule to give every player 1-2 more upgrade cards, maybe of the less good ones that usually aren't taken in the draft. I would also like to give every player 2 more heat cards that start in the deck. Maybe it would also be better to draft all 6 upgrade cards at the beginning of the Grand Prix and no more later, but then you should likely reduce the number of sponsor cards in the early races.\n\nOn the whole the game might need a bit more complexity than just heat management, limiting your speed because of curves, turbo and stress/plus cards and a somewhat random chance for slipstreaming.\n\nIn general I'm not a fan of racing games or racing themes.\nBut I might be more interested in a Rallye or Offroad Iron Man (http://www.abandonia.com/games/28) version of this if done well.\n\nSome cards seem unthematic, especially all-wheel drive in reality gives more control and not more randomness. :/\n\nThe cars are very small and fragile. The gearshift pieces also look fragile. Production on the whole could be better. The box seems unnecessarily big and the insert is bad as usual, wasting space. Just because the game comes with 2 double-sided boards and might add more with expansions doesn't justify making the box 30x30x10cm.\n\nextremely expensive for what it is, especially because you will need 2 expansions if you want to play with 8 players",

Putting down cards from your hand in every turn, doing basic math to calculate how far you'll go and hoping you draw the right cards so you can do what you calculated should happen... It is neither challenging, nor give enough control, and the details of the theme are way off (like putting heat back in the engine when you slow down). Production quality is excellent and it looks really nice too. There are some smart moves (like tailwind) enhancing the experience, but we really didn't feel the need to open the extra modules after the base game was so bland.

The balance in it is built in such a way that the racers are very close throughout the game and at the very end they fight for first place. Great, but here it is brought to the point of absurdity: it feels like all the rounds except the last one didn’t matter at all.\n\nAt the same time, this makes “Heat” a cool family game that is fun to play with children. But personally, I choose “Thunder Road: Vendetta” and “Downforce”, in which crazy situations are constantly generated, and the gameplay is more important than winning.\n\nI wanna note that the content of the core box is impeccable. You can play with 2 players or with 6 players. There are 4 game boards! There are a bunch of modules (Garage, Weather, Championship System, etc.). Eric M.

A lot of effort was put into making it look fun.\n\n+ Most of the game is incredibly thematic - switching gears, slipstreaming, pushing the limits of your engine, etc.\n\n- Some “gamey” mechanics like players getting extra speed or engine cooling simply for being at the back of the pack feel a bit tacked on for the sake of making things more competitive.\n\n\nRules - 1/2\n\n+ On the whole, the rules are relatively simple: pick how many cards you want to play, move that many spaces, and take one or more optional actions.\n\n- The turn structure can be difficult to teach with 9 steps the players need to understand and remember on their turn. Each has a player aid on their board, but it’s not always clear when each step applies.\n\n\nTurn Simplicity - 1.5/2\n\n+ Playing a turn is generally dead simple once players get the hang of the series of steps. It should only take 10-20 seconds to execute everything once they pick their cards.\n\n- Choosing cards can take some time, especially as the game winds down and some turns will activate a ton of required and optional actions that can slow things to a crawl, especially since everyone else just sits around waiting.\n\n\nFun Factor - 1/2\n\n+ This game is a blast at first, moving your race car down the track, figuring out how to trigger a slipstream at the exact right time, and pushing your engine to the limit around the final corner.\n\n- Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of depth, so it gets repetitive after the first few games. The randomness of the deck keeps things interesting, but you’re mostly just trying to slipstream through corners to save heat so you can use it for the final stretch.\n\n- The game has way too many catch up mechanisms for players in the back. It’s important to keep things competitive, but players also need to feel like they had some agency in how they finished.\n\nChallenge and Replayability - 1.5/2\n\n+ The game is definitely challenging - there is an art to choosing the right speed, predicting what your opponents will do, timing a slipstream or some other bonus, managing how many heat cards are in your deck, and when to take a risk.\n\n+ Additional modules like the garage (vehicle mods) and weather (track conditions) can increase replayability.\n\n- Even with the add ons, the game can feels samey and I don’t see it being something that makes Heat a “forever” game.",

Plenty of variants keep it fresh, you really can't go wrong with Heat.\n\nIt gets critiqued for it's catch-up mechanics, and how close every race ends up being, but I like this. You don't want to just get ahead as fast as you can, it's a choose your moment, push your luck, resource management puzzle. With a bunch of fun car upgrades. The more I play this one the more I like it. I do wish the car upgrades were more focused. I'd honestly love to see a heavier version of this system.\n\nI will add however, opening the box and seeing space for 2 extra cars and shifters was extremely frustrating. Just put the 4 plastic pieces, 20-odd cards, and 2 flimsy player mats in the base box. The player count could have been upped by 2 in the base game for an extra $5 tops. This is a shady way to sell expansions and I really dislike it. On top of that, this FOMO-inducing insert doesn't actually fit the actual expansion cards nicely. Pretty poor job on that all around. If you're going to use the insert to sell expansions, make it fit them properly.\n\nGreat game tho",

Les règles sont relativement faciles à comprendre. Le hasard du tirage des cartes fait partie du jeu mais peut être souvent compensé par une bonne anticipation. Si le jeu de base est très complet, les extensions relèvent plus du marketing avec de nouveaux circuits, loin d'être tous intéressants d'ailleurs.",

I think it would be a good family game. Supports higher player counts (5-6). Expansions (Tunnel Vision, Heavy Rain) aren't necessary and don't fit in the main box. Probably the best thing they do is give you a 7th (or 8th) player.",

The trick is to explain rules in a practical way, relating rules and mechanics to how real cars work (even my mum could understand \"hot engine = bad\" and \"go slow = recover strenght\").\nSmall amount of luck that can bsie ealy mitigated with good strategy, very tactical game when everyone can win. The only one in which being last doesn't mean you are really losing.\nExpansions are awesome and add nice little tricks to the experience.\nAlso, if you don't have much time it's easy to adjust game lengths by cutting a lap from the race without ruining experience too much.",
