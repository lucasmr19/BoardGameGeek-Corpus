    "comment": "UPDATE: APR 2025 \n\nHave played more Ark Nova and honestly baffled on how shit this game is in comparison. AN has problems mentioned below the comments but man, at least it doesn't waste your time with make-work nonsense with duplicated resources\n\n===========================\n\nPlayed this more with base game + Prelude and also All-In setup and found problematic things inherent to Euro games. The most usual one: the decision-space exponentially decreases as the game goes on. So, the starting selection of corporations and your starting 10s and then the first few rounds on the race for milestones and then the game stales with subpar decision making. Even the decision of pacing (how fast the game will be) was already decided on the first third of the game.\n\n=====================\n\nGood thematically-immersive card tableau game. There is a great appeal with the hard science and the thematic arc of terraforming mars with private corporations (which is much more thematic imo). The spreadsheety gameplay is fine for as long as you play in a quick pace. At 1.5 hours, this is the right duration for a game of this heft - decisions-wise.\n\nI still prefer Race for the Galaxy or Seasons with its better tougher decisions and faster gameplay. Or Chudyk's card games for their wildness. Or the Pax series for their great thematic immersion.",

Do I give it the lowest possible rating just for political reasons, even if the work doesn't deserve it on the merits?\n\nLuckily, I don't like the game. I'd probably be dropping it to a 2 or 3 (I'd rather play just about anything else) but am happy to go all the way down to 1 to make a statement. It's an overstuffed, unbearably fiddly slog of a solitaire game that takes a ludicrous amount of time and eventually devolves into repetitive accounting problems toward the end, when everybody can see roughly how it's going to play out but things need to be laboriously calculated just to make sure. The components are cheap and ugly, too.",

We are sorry about your disappointment with the cubes. We do take all of these concerns very seriously.\n\nThe\nmanufacturing process for these cubes, which is a double layered plastic injection mold, is very complex. This process causes some chipping on these cubes, especially around the point where the cubes are ejected from from the cube mold, but also in other places\nas well. This is unavoidable in this very new and complex process that we are using, which are likely the first in the industry to execute production of metallic bonded plastic cubes.\n\nWe\napologize for any disappointment you have with these cubes, but we can't replace them.\n\nKind\nRegards,\nIGS\n\nTheir options were either A, replace the faulty parts (I probably would have even paid for the shipping if asked)\n\nOr B alienate me as a customer and ensure I never buy anything from them again.\n\nHow is it an acceptable answer to just say the equivalent of \"well we're using some new process and apparently know that it doesn't quite work but decided to ship it anyway instead of just using some other process that works just fine until we work out the kinks with the new one\". That really doesn't tell me that they are \"taking my concerns seriously\"...\n\nImagine if people that sold other products said something like that?\n\nWell we know the manufacturing process for your car makes scratches on the seats but sorry we can't do anything because we chose a complex process and haven't quite figured it out yet. Also you're not allowed to look inside before you buy to confirm it's condition. We're taking your concerns seriously though...",

The game does little to stop run-away victories, but rather it feels like it helps create them.\n\nIt also just doesn't really fit the current zeitgeist ? \"Terraforming Mars\" feels like a cop-out for the rich abandoning the earth, and we're expected to believe that corporations will work together with humanities best interests in mind ?

    "comment": "To future me: Please read this as a reminder to never play TM again.\n\nFor an engine builder, there is far too much attacking inbuilt in the cards. It's crazy to be that, in a game where you are working together to terraform mars and make it habitable, a core mechanic is stealing and destroying resources others have in order to prevent them from executing their engine.\n\nMost of the cards feel very basic in terms of the effect they have. Much of the time the decision just feels like taking the best card. There is some variety at different points of the game, but there is so much disparity between what is good and what isn't. It feels terrible to have a draw where you are do not get great cards compared to other players who get amazing cards.\n\nI see why people like this game. The requirements on cards forcing you to think about how you terraform and build on the planet, and the end point objectives being at the mercy of players are both great mechanics that makes the game strategic and replayable. For me, the attacky nature and the variance of card quality is not worth it. Sure, drafting in each round fixes this issue somewhat, but at the cost of adding too much time to the play time of the game. Compare this to Agricola, where card quality varies, and the draft fixes things completely, allowing for completely different synergies between cards.\n\nIt's worth reiterating that the components of this game I like in isolation. I like attacking other players to gain advantage when it is executed well (Root, Arcs), unlike in this game where attacking is mainly incidental and can punish you for no reason. I like engine building when you get to really specialize your engine, both in cases where others can block your strategy (Agricola) or in cases where there isn't as much interaction between players (Creature Caravan, Arc Nova, Slay the Spire). I also like goals that are determined by the players (Arc Nova, Arcs). When you add all of this up, the sum is a game that makes me wish that I was playing literally anything else, but mainly a game that makes me wish that I was playing something that was way better in terms of how it feels/plays.",

At least here there is a central board with some slight blocking and milestones to get where you see the other players a bit more, as compared to Ark Nova. Still, the huge draw deck that will take a lot of sessions to get some knowledge of and the enormous pile of cards with icons and abilities that each player amasses is strongly present in this game. I watched a game in long progress recently and was sorely tempted to ask a player to look away from the table and tell me if they really knew what kind of cards their opponents were having. So I ask the question here, and if the answer is yes, well hats off and you can call me stupid I guess. But I find it cluttered and unmanageable, and more importantly, yes, I do feel it doesn’t affect me or my game play decisions that much.\nFinally, the frozen Mars water on the cake are the absolutely horrible components. If the flimsy player boards are touched in the slightest, there is a big chance the cubes move around, which is of course a big issue for the ones tracking production. Even if you like the game, you cannot convince me this is not an issue (and no, I won’t accept deluxe boards or home made stuff as an answer; this review is about the game as it is sold in the box).",

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not knocking anyone who enjoys it—but let’s be real, compared to the top games out there today, it just doesn’t hold up. The game is loved by people who claim to dislike randomness, yet it’s one of the most random experiences I’ve ever had at the table.\n\nThe whole premise of the game—competing as corporations to terraform Mars by raising the temperature, increasing oxygen levels, and creating oceans—sounds fascinating on paper. You’re balancing resource management, playing unique project cards, and competing for the best spots on the board. The idea of gradually transforming the planet and vying for milestones and awards should create a tense, engaging experience. But in practice? It falls flat for me.\n\nThe late game, in particular, feels like it plays itself. You’re left making obvious, point-based decisions that lack any real excitement or strategic depth. It’s a grind, and not the kind that leaves you feeling satisfied when you finally reach the end. After just a few plays, I knew this one wasn’t for me. If someone suggests Terraforming Mars on game night, I’d honestly rather sit out and do something else. The game just doesn’t live up to the massive hype it’s built around it.",

Not only for the uninspiring game but also because of the designer and the family behind it that are clearly right wing transphobic people. Don't want to put my money and time in this company again. And if that's not enough, using uninspiring AI in their design and art on their latest kickstarter only to make money faster as a cash cow... too bad.\n\nUpdate 03/02/2017: I'm downrating the game from 9 to 6. The game is very much take-that with 2 players, a little bit too much for my taste, especially if you count in the amount of luck in the draw. There are a couple of disjointed cards with the sole purpose of taking resources away from your opponents. In a game that is already is luck-heavy and tight on scores, this feels like lazy design. Secondly, game lasts around +2.5 hours which is just too much to see it on the table very regularly. I heard from a lot of people that drafting cards minimizes luck but it would even drag this game more than it does now.\n\nThird, after playing for several hours, it seems like the scores are too tight in the end. In both games we played, scores of first and 2nd/3rd player differed with 1 point only which is very marginal and one take that action made the difference between a win or a loss, if you count in the high luck factor of drawing the card you would need, this is a no-go for me, especially if it lasts 2+ hours.\n\nComponent quality is also so-so - with all the lightweight cubes on the flimsy score boards, one sweep with the arms of a nearby kid would wash 3 hours of game play away in one move... luckily it didn't happen to us but I just imagine...\n\nAfter all, it's a good thematic game with a lot of interesting scientific events that make sense. A game I like but not love because of the long play time, the take that cards and the tight end game scores and the flimsy production counters.\n\nI sold my copy and haven't regretted it until now. This is the game I would have liked but in the end started to dislike\n\nInitial rating (9): Very good thematical game with a good combination of hand management, economic motor and tile laying with awards and milestones goals. Plays very swiftly! Only downside is the clumsy rulebook and the thin player boards. Until now the best game of 2016 together with Clank!",

Проходит час, второй - а вы еще ничего не сделали, только сидите и крутите карты, да перекладываете туда-сюда эти кубики, плюс постоянно считаете деньги, но не потому что это ваш выбор, и не потому что вы продумываете траты, а потому что просто бухгалтерия! 90% времени игры проходит за перекладыванием этих кубиков трёх металлических цветов, иногда да, вы двигаете тепло или кислород, и совсем редко - выкладываете один тайлик на карту раз в полчаса. Господи, какая же это тягомотина! О какой стратегии может идти речь? Карты идут чисто рандомно, их еще и покупать надо! А это значит что надо опять вычитать, высчитывать, сколько надо кубиков отнять, чтобы деньги верно отметить на планшете. Реально, это смерть, а не игра. Просто не понимаю, откуда у неё 8.5. Ну честное слово, люди, у вас там всё в порядке? 8к потратил на это. Это лютейшее недоразумение, это игра для тех, кому жить уже не хочется, а хочется просто сидеть и бездумно перекладывать эти кубы ресурсов туда-сюда-туда-сюда. И типа \"покорять марс\".

Все только и говорят, какая она хорошая. Ага. 8.5. 10/10. Но честно, это прям очень, очень, очень плохая игра. Плохой дизайн, страшнейший неудобный менеджмент на планшете, полная рандомность карт и рутинность, безысходность игрового процесса. Я бы лучше бы реально 4 часа полы мыл, пыль протирал и вещи в тазу руками стирал. Это и то более концентрированный экспириенс с большим импактом, чем то, что происходит 4 часа в ПМ.",

Point 1 has been worsened by first the draft variant (and players who insist on it even when teaching a new player), and now by too many expansions which add lots of extra clockwork but no added “punch” to the game.\n\nOverall: promising but flawed, and done better (and importantly with a greater game-to-time density) elsewhere.",

    "comment": "Having a deck of a hundred-plus cards which only lends itself to four or five overarching strategies is deeply disappointing. Further, the game actively discourages strategic thought by obfuscating future card draws, meaning that most of the gameplay is just rolling with the punches at a tactical level for a few hours. That sounds like a distraction - but not a deep, interesting, or otherwise worthwhile game.",

    "comment": "I shall start by saying that this was not what I was expecting. I hadn’t read a lot about Terraforming Mars as it looked to me like a heavy weight, dry euro game and I’m just not enjoying those at the moment. However, I was quite surprised to find that it is a light-medium weight card game that has a board in the same way that Trains is a deck builder with a board.\n\nIt is an interesting beast and seems to be a patchwork of different ideas ripped from other games; in fact, I haven’t played a game, watched a film or read a book in recent memory that so obviously and so liberally borrowed concepts and ideas from its piers. I’ll get on to that a bit more later, but first we’ll look at how it plays.\n\nFor your first game you will start with “Beginner Companies”, which is to say that they are all the same. The same starting resources, the same starting production and no special powers. You then get dealt a hand of 10 cards each from the top of an enormous deck (which would have been twice the size if you haven't taken out the ‘advanced cards’) and that’s it. Almost the entire game revolves around these cards.\n\nThe cards themselves are loosely split into 3 types: green, blue and red. Green are the most common and usually involve a onetime bonus, such as increasing the amount of one resources that you produce at the end of the round or increase the amount of that resources that you have right now. Others are a more complex, such as exchanging one unit of one resource for 2 of another, but once they have been used they are added to your tableau where the squat there until the end of the game. They have no further effects but there are icons at the top which may be relevant for scoring. Then you have the rarer blue cards, which usually give you a powerful bonus of playing them, such as a pile of resource X and then sit in your tableau and can be activated again once a round for a benefit, usually a resource cube. Lastly there are the somewhat common red cards, which usually (but not always) screw over another player by targeting their resources, ability to produce resources, or their tableau. These again are one shot and are then discarded.\n\nYou can take one or two actions on your turn, or you can pass, which means that you can no longer take part in the rest of the round. There is a list of actions that you can take, but mostly (and especially early on) you will be simply playing cards from your hands to create a tableau. Except that sometimes you won’t.\n\nIssue 1\n\nAn issue that I picked up on early in the game is that a lot of cards have costs or requirements that have to be met, similar to Spartacus where you have to have a certain amount of influence to play. Here it may be that one of the 3 tracks has to be above or below or on a certain number. This created a peculiar situation whereby within your initial hand of 10 cards, there may only be one or two that you can play. Chances are that it won't be until later in the round and through other players affecting the game state that you will be able to play a second or third card, which could turn out to be the last. This somewhat uneven setup can create a real imbalance within the first round, whereby some players with rush of with the beginnings of fantastic engines, whereas some will just be left floundering, which leads me into my second issue.\n\nIssue 2\n\nIssue number 2 with the game, is that it has a bit of a runaway leader issue that also tends to reward those who are doing well and punish those who are not. For example it is not uncommon that after the first round in your first few games, one player will probably have been able to play quite a few cards from his hand, say 2 greens, 2 reds and 1 blue. As such they will have quite a substantial lead, will have knocked the other players backwards as well as getting a powerful blue card out that could be activated each round for free. At this point you will look who is in what position in terms of score; it is likely that this is exactly how the game will finish. I think the issue herein lies that your current victory point total is your base income! Meaning that the more VPs you have, the more money you have in the next round meaning you can play and more importantly, buy more cards, making your tableau and therefore your position stronger. Interestingly, the only way (apart from a few spaces on the board) that you can obtain new cards is between round where you are dealt 4 at random and can then choose to keep as many as you like, but have to pay 3 credits each. Therefore, the better you are doing, the more money you have, the more cards you can buy, the more cards you can play, the better you do. It ramps up exponentially. Furthermore, the red cards can be devastating; if you are lucky enough to be dealt them then you have to be able to afford to play them. This again means that the player with the most resources can further trample on the weak engines of those who they are trying to catch up. Then we come to the mile stones. These add a race element to the game, such as being the first to put 3 cities on the board, or the first to put down 8 vegetation tiles or build 8 buildings (represented by the brown building symbol on some of the cards in your tableau). So, if you are doing well and winning, chances are you will be the first to complete one or more of these, giving you a 5 VP bonus for each. However, to complete them you have to buy them at a cost. Now, a balancing mechanic that I have seen in a lot of games is that the first person to a powerful achievement has to pay the most, or faces an additional barrier, such as in Le Havre where in order to use the dock to build an iron ship, you also have to ‘modernise’ it by paying additional brick resources. In Terraforming Mars, it is the opposite; the first person to reach a milestone gets it for 8 and then the price goes up to 16 and then 24 for subsequent ones. Furthermore, there are 5 available but only 3 can be claimed and each only once, so it is entirely possible that you could be locked out of ever getting one. There are also awards which work in much the same way to further exasperate the issue.\n\nIssue 3\n\nThis game can be extremely random, with the cards that you draw and that your opponents draw determining what actions can be taken over the course of the entire round. At this point I should point out the on the board are printed a selection of “Public Endeavours”, which can be used by anyone and function in a similar way to the green cards, in that you spend credit and take the action, such as putting down a vegetation tile, ocean tile etc. The issue with these, and the reason why I have neglected to mention them up until this point, is that they are just far too expensive and limited. Furthermore, as there are not cards involved, there is nothing to add into your tableau, therefore potentially denying yourself VPs at the end of the game from scoring certain icons. However, they are there and it would be remiss of me not to mention them. Back to the issue in hand. This game borrows quite heavily from Seasons (and apparently Race for the Galaxy, but I haven’t played that), but without the ability to plan out your turns. To mitigate the inherent luck in Seasons, you claim all of the cards that you will be using over the course of the game at the beginning, and then can allocated them evenly to each of the games 3 round. This way you know in advance what is going to be available and therefore you can plan accordingly.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, in Terraforming Mars you are at the mercy of your starting hand, a massive deck of unique card, and then at the mercy of what cards you draw throughout the course of the game. There is simply no way to get around the fact that some cards are just much better than others, and some cards combine really well, but only if you get them both into your hand. This wouldn’t be such an issue with a smaller car pool, but the deck around 200 unique cards and therefore the chances of getting the 2 or 3 that you need is slim at best. Other games that rely heavily on cards get around this by having a central pool of cards that you can purchase, think Nations, Through the Ages and City of Iron, which allow you to mitigate some of the randomness and plan accordingly. Furthermore you can see if a player takes a card that could affect you negatively compose a strategy to protect yourself against the potentially negative effects of that. In Terraforming Mars you never know what card players have received or have in their hands. Furthermore, anything that they choose not to buy is discarded face down so that you have no idea what they are planning and how it could potentially affect you. This can be problematic, especially as the margins between success and failure can be so small, but also removes some of the interaction as you are no longer interested in other players turns until they hit you with something that causes your economy to crumble.\n\nFurthermore, there is also the issue that as there are is not a set number of turns - there are no ages and therefore no progression in what cards are available and when. This means that you may be dealt a hand of late game cards early on, which are effectively useless, or early game cards at the end when all you want to do is add VPs to your tableau, both of which can be very frustrating. Going back to Spartacus, which often is criticised for the blind drawing of cards during the intrigue phase, this offsets these issues by allowing you to sell the cards as you get them, with a reward that is roughly equivalent to the cards usefulness, meaning that if you have cards that you cannot or do not want to use, you can sell them immediately for a sizeable reward in coins which you will be able to use on a later phase. In Terraforming Mars, if you are dealt cards that are of no use, then tough luck, you just discard them for nothing and the actions that are available to you on the following turn are now far more limited.\n\nA way to get around this somewhat is by using the card drafting variant, as described in the back of the rule book, which leads me on to …\n\nIssue 4\n\nPlaytime. This game is not quick, despite being relatively simple. Our first play with 3 of us clocked in at around 2 hours 45 minutes, which is quite a chunk of time. As a point of reference it took us longer to play Terraforming Mars with 3 then it did to play Mage Knight the week prior with 3. The drafting method, which follows standard drafting rules and is implemented between rounds when you received the 4 random cards, further adds to this play time. Furthermore, I’m not sure how suited this game is to drafting, as all of the cards are so random, or situational, or unique that you can really plan or create combinations as you don’t know if you will ever get the other cards required in a later draft, if at all, to make your engine work, or if a really situation card will ever be relevant. The best drafting games work because there is a small subset of car types, but variations within each set. For example, within Blood Rage (or 7 Wonders) there are combat cards, clan upgrades, monsters and quests. You know roughly what you need, what you are likely to get and what can be made to work with what. There is also a far greater margin for error and ability for the player to express themselves through the well throughout curation of cards over the draft phase. All of this is missing from the TM drafting, where you are again fumbling in the dark hoping to hit upon a winning hand.\n\nIssue 5\n\nI won’t spend too long on this one, but the components are a joke for a game that costs £65. The card stock is some of the thinnest I have ever seen, then player boards are the same and look like they have been designed in MS paint and the art across the game is inconsistent and poor.\n\nIn conclusion, Terraforming Mars is, in my humble opinion, an okay game, but one that mechanically just isn’t very good. It reminds me of a pop song that is at first striking, but on subsequent listens just doesn’t hold up. It is also endemic of the myopic nature of board games that this currently resides at number 4 on BGG, as it does make a great first impression, after which the masses rush to the website to rate it as the best thing ever, when in reality and upon reflection, it is anything but.\n\nThe best thing I can say about TM is that it is a good distraction hiding a poor game.",

This doesn't feel right at all.)\n- there's not much strategy beyond \"Use the cards to build your engine\" (You avoid this, and you lose.

It's practically a solitaire game which relies on knowing a lot of the 208 project cards and how they synch to multiply benefits. So new players have either to put in tedious hours of homework or suffer repeated plays.\n\nWe played a 2P game with no drafting. It was pointless drafting since I wouldn't have known what to look for anyway. Regardless, I was stuck for MANY rounds waiting for one single icon (tag) to appear in the draw. I understood the bloody game, it's very basic in its processes. It just takes hours and hours and you need to know what you are doing before you start.\n\nFive hours. I made slight errors, in that I didn't realise you could go into negative money, and I missed exploiting pushing the temp up which would have kept me closer in TR/money. But the game snowballed away and by the end I was passijg and watching my friend carry on another 10 or 20 actions.\n\nSo yeah, it's just another Agricola or RFTG or whatever dressed up in new pants. The people that think this is fun dominate BGG so yah boo. It's not.",

The effects are usually spectacular, like crashing a second moon or nuking some part of Mars.\n\nIt takes up a lot of space when playing, you really need the plexiglass overlays for managing your chits - that are NOT present in the game itself. Even for the $80 the makers didn't care for them.\nGameplay wise:\nThe card drafting is very weird especially if you have no idea what is in the deck. So you're just blindly flaying around in the dark on the odd chance you hit some combo.\nI like that you get points for reaching some temperature/oxygen threshold, but everyone is competing with that; I like the bonuses to go for.\nIn the end it's just hard to make the cards work for you and for that it takes too long.\nIt's like Race for the Galaxy the board game plus untold expansions in Race.\nI don't hate to play it, but will only choose to play it if there is nothing else. But it certainly does not deserve an 8+.\nIf your group likes Innovation, TM is just like that. But far longer.",

The main difference being that you die of boredom rather than whatever it is that kills you first on Mars, which for all I know could also be boredom.\n\nSeriously, you're planting trees and creating oxygen and placing cities and pushing a bunch of cubes around for no apparent reason, and wow here comes a card with a volcano, but it's the pointless kind of volcano which doesn't wipe out your civilization in a glorious wash of superheated stuff that comes out of volcanoes like in movies. And there's a card with a puppy. Oh, back to the trees and cubes. Okay, time to count your trees and cubes and puppies--okay, I'm not sure if you count puppies--and shiny things. And...oh, too late, everyone has died.\n\nI feel very confident that a large majority of people on this website would rate this game about an 8.4, a number which I totally did not look at in the upper leftish area of my screen while I was typing. This probably proves something about the appalling taste in games of the sort of people this site caters to. But I don't want to be impolite, so I won't say anything more other than to again mention the word \"appalling.\" And \"nauseating.\" And \"good gravy, it's like having a fat squirrel living in your hair, and even though he is polite and fairly sluggish, he has an overactive bladder.\" But no more. I don't want to be impolite.\n\nIn addition to obvious queries like \"What's for dinner?\" and \"What's that thing over there?\" I feel sure you are asking yourself, \"Why is this internet person who I've never met but care deeply about watching people play this game so much?\" Well, the answer is long and complicated, and it involves octopods and beets and voodoo spells and general stupidity. But in its simplest form, the explanation is that sometimes the vicious, painful realization of just how stupid a thing is that I am doing is not enough to overcome my laziness. Also, I wanted to see if the puppy would survive. Spoiler alert: There are no puppy-shaped spacesuits.",

    "comment": "Terraforming Mars is a game about… well, terraforming Mars (biggest plot twist since Snakes on a Plane). The parameters towards achieving this are raising the temperature, placing oceans and raising oxygen levels. Each player controls a corporation, which can be basic or have an asymmetric start/power. The theme is cool and it’s very well implemented.\n\nThis is a game about building an engine through playing cards, moving cubes around your player boards, placing tiles trying to maximize your points, and achieving milestones. Engine builders like this are fairly MPS, so all this game could have aspired to was being a pleasant euro and an OK game. Instead, it’s garbage. Here’s why.\n\n1. The game takes way too long. Really, way too long. I’m not a big fan of RftG, but it did a similar thing in about 30 minutes, and that’s very good. Here, you are looking at about 2h, even more at high player counts. Besides, the fact that laying tiles gives you extra points means that everybody usually wants to scrape those extra points and finish with a high score, so more often than not people keep turtling instead of triggering the end game. And to be honest, as much as I hate it, I don’t even blame the players when they do it. This doesn’t feel like a race, so I get when people get incentivized to scrape some more points in a point salad game.\n\n2. A lot of cards are useless. I know I’m just repeating the same complaint of every person who dislikes this game, but it’s just so painful. It wasn’t so difficult to divide cards into eras. Why would you do this? You can get cards at the beginning of the game whose requirements will not be met for ages, or you can get cards at the end of the game that can only be used when the terraforming process is at an early stage. The recommended “solution” is to do the draft, which would add more time to a game that’s already too long for what it is.\n\n3. Multiplayer solitaire. Like most engine builders, you make one or two choices at the beginning of the game, which will script your strategy. You played a card that will give you money every time you bring the heat up? Well, guess what you’re going to be doing. For some reason, they decided it was a good idea to include a few (very few) “take that” cards, which make no sense in this type of game and don’t really make it feel interactive, they just make the rest of the table think you’re a dick who’s messing with their stuff in a game that’s purely about doing your own thing and comparing scores at the end.\n\n4. Art and production. The art is not coherent whatsoever. There’s a mix of different styles, photographies, cartoons… an absolute mess. But that’s not a big problem. Quality is, though. I’ve played some games +20 times and they looked better than TfM right out of the box. The cubes had chipped corners from day 1. The board’s quality was so bad that it started to peel, which hasn’t happened to me ever before (or after) with any board game. The player boards were also thin cardstock and the cubes would move out of place too easily, basically ruining everything.\n\nYes, I’ve heard that Prelude speeds up the game, and people made 3D printed stuff to hold the cubes in the player boards, and I’m happy that fans of the game found those alternatives to improve the experience, but I don’t think I should be paying extra and buy expansions to make something playable. I would buy expansions for variety or extra content in a game I love, not to fix anything. If anything, I’d be paying quite a bit to make a game that’s a 3/10 go up to a 5 or 6, and that’s not worth my time.\n\nMogul Scale: 3/B.",

The game had moments of competition for goals and tile placement, and I enjoyed using the one attack card I saw all game, but nowhere near enough interaction for its timeframe.

    "comment": "The mass appeal of this game eludes me. Terraforming Farce.\n\nThis is one of the few games where I dabbled with its digital version, having played about 20 games. Whatever people like about this game goes right over my head.\n\n-Many board games have players doing math, but at least they obfuscate it. \"Is this card worth paying 3 wood and 2 stone, versus this other card worth 2 wood and 3 stone, and a slightly different benefit?\" In Terraforming Mars, everything is outright arithmetic. Players are doing double-digit subtractions on most turns. \"I have 34 money. This card costs me 20, minus 2 because of this other card, and I have 2 steel that I can spend as 2 money each--no, 3 money each! Then I will get a refund of 3 money because it has this other tag. If I spend 3 money now to draft this card, will I have enough money to also play this 23-cost card in my hand that I desperately want?\"\n-There are several resources, but they are mostly different forms of money.\n-Energy turning into heat automatically during each production phase is odd, and essentially makes energy production a resource in and of itself. This feels like a rough edge that should have been smoothed out.\n-It is difficult to get more cards. Drafting cards each generation helps. I would never recommend to anyone (including first-timers) to play Terraforming Mars without drafting or without using the Corporate Era cards. But it is very difficult without a Race-for-the-Galaxy Explore-style action.\n-The most interesting part of the game is the beginning. Choosing your starting corporation and the cards that match, then finding a way to get something going amid the dearth of resources in the opening generations... This is what I want, but throughout the whole game, not only at the beginning. There is another game that offers me exactly such decisions: it's called Race for the Galaxy.\n-There are a few peaks of interest--such as racing for milestones and fighting for awards, and the last few ticks on the global parameters--but the game is otherwise a lull after the opening excitement.\n-The \"take that\" elements feel extremely out of place in a Euro that otherwise has no direct player interaction. I understand why those cards are there, but they stand out as incongruent.\n-Terraforming Mars long and has a lot of components (what other games have generic counters in of several denominations for something other than money?), but does not create an experience which is rich enough or different enough to justify all that effort.\n\nI've read many reviews of this game, spoken to loads of people, and read books on game design, but I still don't grasp what makes Terraforming Mars an above-average game, let alone one of the highest-ranked games on BGG. I am continuously shocked by the casual gamers who not only tolerate, but enjoy a game of this scope.\n\nThat said, I totally respect that others love this game, and am not trying to detract from that. I also respect the repeat plays from the game's fans. It's hard to find games these days that people want to play dozens of times over. I only wish one such fan could cogently explain to me why!\n\nThankfully, Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition streamlines the board game, focusing on the hand management aspect I enjoy, and doing away with the spatial element of the game board. Ares Expedition lives in the shadow of Race for the Galaxy, but Ares is considerably easier to teach to new players.\n\nI'm glad I gave Terraforming Mars another chance over the table, after a 7-year break. Who knows? When we finally land a person on Mars, I just might give this board game another play.",

I was going heavy on leaves, and it seemed every other turn I'm getting hit on trees, no other resource was having that done.\n\nBefore starting I thought the temperature and oxygen might be a cool mechanic since some of the cards have requirements based on them. Since money is tight buying cards for later in the game felt like a waste.\n\nMost of the cards seemed to just bump one production engine up and lowering another. That was a big part of the game and a total snooze/busy work. Keeping track of everything on that board is chore as well and precarious.\n\nJust not very fun for me. Many other, better engine builders out there.

    "comment": "Played once in person and 5 or 6 more times online over Tabletop Simulator and the app version. Legitimately can't see what all the fuss is about and think the game is overhyped. Some of the things I really disliked about Terraforming Mars:\n\n• The game is too dependent on luck-of-the-draw cards. The drafting variant only partially fixes this at the expense of extending an already over-long game.\n\n• The Standard Actions or whatever they were called are not cost effective and therefore pretty pointless and the rewards section of the board helps rich players which is another problem; the rich get richer in this game as money is tied to victory points.\n\n• Card cost and window of opportunity to play many of them is punishing. The deck should have been split for early game and late game options which would have helped the theme more.\n\n• The game is just too damn long for what it is and it's pretty ugly as well with wildly inconsistent art styles. Downtime can be very high with some players having to pass again and again while others just keep on going.\n\n• The game has a “rich get richer” problem with no suitable catch up mechanic and things cost more on the board if you're the second or third person to go for them, further compounding this problem.\n\n• The game is nowhere near as “thematic” as people claim with some cards making zero sense in the early phase of terraforming a planet (Pets or a Sports Complex for instance!)\n\n• The game is basically “multiplayer solitaire” with very little player interaction compared with other similar Eurogames. \"Take that\" cards don't count, sorry!\n\n• The game attempts to give the impression of a variety of strategies but ultimately fails in this as you need certain card types to mesh with your chosen corporation and sometimes it just doesn't work out and creates imbalances.\n\nI am pretty fair and balanced with my board game reviews and ratings and wanted to like this one but it just did absolutely nothing for me and the more I think about it the more annoyed I get with it. It's in my Top 5 miserable \"I wont get those X hours of my life back\" board game experiences. Everything is subjective but IMHO there is no way this game deserves it's high BGG rating!\n\n\"Don't Buy This\" Reason: Joe owns this.",

    "comment": "Going into this game I knew I was going to absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. Unfortunately, I absolutely hated it.\n\nWhere do I start? Let's start with expectations. Going into this I knew that it would be a card-based engine builder with little interaction and with a superfluous board. All of that was true. The core idea is fine. The lack of interaction was really tough considering how long the game took (2-2.5h our first game). The board was nice to look at, but yeah there wasn't much going on. All of that was as I expected, and that hasn't killed other games for me in the past\n\nWhat really killed the game for me was the deck composition. For example, I've heard this compared to Race for the Galaxy. This game is a lot less interesting than Race and that's because Race has many iterweaving strategies. A card in Race can be good for several different strategies, and what makes Race compelling is deciding whether to continue keeping your options open or formulating and committing to a particular strategy. Terraforming Mars on the other hand - the approach to deck construction is more compositional in the sense that a bunch of strategies were created on individual cards, then the cards were added to the same deck. I felt like I was just trying to make pre-baked strategies work by digging for the cards for my strategy. The game felt a lot more confined and a lot less exploratory\n\nTerraforming Mars reminded me a lot of Jacob's After the Virus in the sense that it has a lot of rough edges. TM is the more complex game and arguably the better game, but it still has plenty that had me scratching my head. The tile placement subgame felt mostly irrelevant. Tiles placement works best when adjacency really matters and there was very little of that here. The awards and milestones seemed wildly swingy. In our game there was no real nail biting contest for any of these like there is in say a 4p game of Suburbia or even Ticket to Ride. Scoring in general felt a little off. I did like how some things like card requirements and energy converting into heat worked, but there was a lot left on the table that felt underdeveloped as far as mechanics go\n\nTerraforming Mars is yet another overhyped game with little interaction. I don't really understand what people love about it. To me it felt like we've been down this road before (i.e. tableau-based engine building) and this was all done 10x better years ago. But that's just my opinion - you're free to have your own. Terraforming Mars is fine, but it doesn't belong in the top 100 (let alone top 3)",

But while I originally gave this a 7 rating, I decided to downgrade the rating to reflect the reality of my reaction to it when it gets proposed in my group: meh. It's just not what I want to play.\n\nFirst, it's a little too much group-solitaire for me, with the few direct player interactions (primarily asteroids) being too jarring, consequential, and unbalanced.\n\nBut the main problem for me is the incredible complexity of everybody's engine. By mid-game the engines are all pretty complex, often involving a lot of cards, and taking up so much mental energy that it's hard to have a full-game strategy that is reacting to other players. I appreciate that there are a lot of different engine styles, and that you have to build your engine with the cards you get (and be flexible and adept at doing so), but that also means that other people's engines can be very hard to understand and monitor. At a certain point I kind of give up watching the other players; I'm not familiar with all of their cards or how they work and so I just have to accept what they're doing. I don't mind having to trust that my opponents are playing their cards correctly, but I do mind that they have to trust me to do so! It's almost too much pressure and takes away some of the fun of playing a multi-player game; I like folks commenting on each other's plays and strategies, but here they are so complex and unique that that happens less frequently than other games.\n\nUltimately, the last few times I've seen TM session on another table at the mid-point or later, with everybody having a ton of cards in front of them, moving their bits around and talking through their engine actions, I've breathed a huge sigh of relief that I'm not playing. I'm sure I'll play it again, but I doubt it will be my first pick, knowing that I'll probably end up being fodder to folks that can handle these complex engines better than me. There are worse ways to spend an evening, however, and there are plenty of fun/interesting aspects of the game, so for now 6 it is.",

    "comment": "A pretty unremarkable card-based tableau builder that has somehow wormed its way to the top of the charts.\n\nA big chunk of the deck and most of the standard projects do nothing more than nudge a cube up a track to increase passive income or push the game timer. Engine building effects (aside from income increases) and emergent combos are vanishingly rare; there is very little sense of growing complexity aside from having a bit more money to throw around in the later turns, which feels like a waste when cards can offer such rich variability.\n\nTM also breaks my one rule with card-based games like this: players need to draw cards. Lots of them. Without draw power, players are at the mercy of variance and have very little control of their fate, and TM has some of the weakest draw power I've ever seen. Players get a pitiful drip feed of cards (that they have to pay to even add to their hand!) that may have stringent requirements to play and cannot be meaningfully used to facilitate other actions ala Race for the Galaxy's economy. The beginning of each generation is usually a tiring exercise of turning down a tiny pool of obviously useless cards and wishing you could draw three times as many so you could actually make a meaningful decision with what to buy. There are even games where some players are implicitly disqualified from competing because they never see any of the condition-less income boosters (which are desperately needed early game) hidden in the massive deck. It's rare, but not rare enough for a game of this length.\n\nFans will say that the drafting variant helps solve all this by increasing the number of cards you see per game, but relying on an advanced variant that slows the game down to a crawl to only somewhat fix a central issue feels super lame. Just let me draw more cards dammit.\n\nAnd despite there being a \"map\", spatial player interaction is almost nonexistent, and the board state has no meaningful connection to the card tableaus aside from some cursory special tile placements. The board mostly feels like a big VP tracker and could have easily been abstracted away to the three primary timer tracks.\n\nEven the interesting theme has been corporatized into depressing staleness. There are older and newer games in this genre that look better, play better, and cost less. Seventy bucks for TM on the BGG shop is insane.",

    "comment": "Player interaction is too low because playing cards usually does nothing to other players. Map resources only add little interaction elements to the game because there are only a few good spots\n\nCard drafting is not as interactive as I thought because a Jupiter player can just hold these cards for the whole game. You cannot hate draft his Jupiter cards because you simply don’t know someone is going for it. But it is too late to hate draft when someone starts playing Jupiter cards because he already gets what he needs in the game. No game mechanics can stop him from playing his Jupiter cards from his hand\n\nMilestone is theoretically another interaction element between players, but the fact that certain corporations having great advantage in getting certain milestones (e.g. getting 3 city tiles with a corporation which starts with one city) greatly reduce such competition. Players tend to do their own thing because overcoming such an advantage is hard.\n\nCards are imbalanced. The difference between good cards and big cards are huge. Cards which allow players to build a city are always good in any situation\n\nThe game is very combo dependent. If the starting hand don’t go well with the two starting corporations, you would have a tough game against a player whose starting hand goes well with his starting hand. This, together with the imbalanced card mentioned above makes the game very luck dependent\n\nTo make things worse, the game plays unreasonably long because the game can only end when 3 parameters reaches their max. Since one player cannot build an engine which focuses on all 3 parameters, a player focusing on temperature cannot end the game because he has nearly no control to oxygen level and ocean while his engine cannot earn him points anymore. It is common that 1 of the 3 parameters is rarely touched on so that the game lasts at least 3 hours even when prelude is added\n\nTo sum up, I am not willing to spend 3+ hour on a low interaction, luck dependent game",

Never mind tracking all other players' abilities and what to prevent them from getting. I guess I can summarize as excessive rules / paperwork... I much prefer elegant rule sets in my games.\n\n2) Runaway leader: There are a couple cards that allow you to damage other players, but these are rare.

Most turns have very little implications for what you'll be able to do more than 4 turns in the future. There's little snowballing or developing any kind of coherent strategy, just grabbing up what's generally possible in the moment. So you usually won't find any benefit in planning far ahead, nor in trying to block other players, since there's always a ton of ways to earn points and you're never honed in on any angle in particular. Also the game really drags on, which when any given move isn't all that critical really makes it dry.

It's not particularly gorgeous or opulent in its components, there are actually semi-frequent complaints about the art and cubes (complaints I don't actually share, it should be noted), and otherwise it's a combo-happy, card-driven engine-builder in a sea of such titles. Why this one is just the right mix mystifies me a bit, because I can't look at one element of the game and go \"Oh ok, I get it. Even if it's not for me, I get the appeal.\"\n\nInstead, to me it's just a bit too long and dry for what it delivers, and with a lot of upkeep and card-parsing or resource-shuffling minutia to stifle any momentum the game tries to build. Turns consist of parsing tiny text on a bunch of cards, micromanaging too many resources on too many tracks, and cross-referencing a bunch of areas on the board at various point just to make simple decisions.\n\nAnd your attention is everywhere except where I'd prefer it: on the other players and the shared experience of the game. Oh, there are minor races to bonuses and such, but this is a heads-down experience. It's Race for the Galaxy with half the aplomb in its implementation, a third of its kinetic pace, and about five times the components and rules overhead.",

    "comment": "In this game, players get a hand of unique cards, and then on their turn they chose to take 1 or 2 actions, which could be playing a card, using a previously played ongoing effect card, or paying some number of accumulated resources to bump a marker up one of the charts on the central board. Each time you improve a chart, you get a victory point.\n\nThe game has a lot of luck in terms of which cards you wind up getting, and a lot of downtime between turns as players ponder which of their many many cards to activate. There are few, but never the less frustrating take that cards, which have very minor benefits for the player who plays them. They feel out of place in a game that's otherwise a victory points race. Another aspect of this game that I don't enjoy is that this is one of those games where as charts cap out and the game progresses, there's less and less to do with your engine. I tend to enjoy games that start out with few options, and you grow from there. On the central board, you have a hex map where you can place your plants and cities, but most of these spaces are empty, and there's apparently very little reason to place in one spot vs another spot, contributing to what's ultimately a very bland experience.\n\nThe component quality isn't great. Everything looks very bland, which isn't a deal-breaker, but the art of the cards is incredibly uneven in quality, which does bother me a bit. In a better overall game this would be forgivable. There are many games like this, where players wind up with just a huge mess of cards in their tableaus and I don't see why I would ever chose this over any of the others.",

Scoring is tedious, when you're colonizing Ganymede or other planets near Mars they almost give you no score at the end of the game, and you're just wasting your color cubes (there are too few of them, even when just 2 of you play the game). The game doesn't come with enough resource cubes (especially when you play with more than 2 people), and aforementioned color cubes. The components are really badly made, the cubes crumble in the bag, and if you happen to accidentally drop them, better have no hopes for them to pass unscathed. The paint is coming off the cards, and the cards themselves are really useless (especially at the mid/end of the game), you just take the cards from the pile, counting for 'this 1 out of 10 cards' to give you some real benefits. I know the deck-building and drafting games are about luck and drawing, building around it to make the most profit, but in this game, it doesn't speak to me.

    "comment": "Prior to 2020: 2 plays\n\nTM is one of those games I thought I'd love, being the engine-building fanboy that I am, but I came away with conflicted thoughts, rather than a ringing endorsement.\n\nFirst, the positives: TM does a phenomenal job of highlighting the science and process behind the theoretical process of terraforming, while also creating a game that has many different card combinations and interactions for players to discover. These two concepts combine to give players a real sense of growth, as their corporations grow to be quite substantial and complex (seriously, there's so many cards on the table by the end of a game). These are aspects of the game I appreciate and feel are worth noting.\n\nThe negatives, however, really pull this game down for me. To start, I know it's been mentioned at length, but the component quality (particularly player boards) and artwork are substantially underwhelming and inconsistent, which makes the game feel far less engaging than it could be in the hands of a publisher known for their aesthetics. These complaints aside, the biggest issue I have with TM is that it's a game that it substantially bloated and lacks the polish I'd expect from a game of this renown. Certainly, the game provides players a series of decisions surrounding opportunity costs and strategic goals, but the high degree of variance among the cards can lead to a less-than stable game, leading to more tactical adaptations than strategic planning, which hurts in a game that is also so incredibly long for what it is (a reasonably-solitaire, optimization Euro). The introduction of multiple resources also seems interesting, but these really just operate as multiple currencies, changing the valuation of certain cards, but not really forcing players to think about these resources in dramatically different ways. This feeling of \"blandness\" is further experienced when one realizes that so much of the game is waiting for one's turn to finish out the strategy that they planned during the draft and that is forced by the activation of the many cards in their engine, which they must do each round in order to reap the benefits. All of this combines to create a game that while interesting, just leaves me wishing I'd played a crunchier engine-builder in a shorter amount of time (see: Race for the Galaxy, Ginkgopolis, etc - both of which provide just as, if not more, interesting decisions in 1/2 or 1/8 the time).\n\nTM is not a bad game, but it's a bloated, messy one that seems to have gained popularity for its relative accessibility and timing of release. A game I'd play every once and a while (but only with very, very experienced players who play FAST), but not one I feel the need to run back to.",

I'm being reductive, but accurate.\n\nTM conflates cognitive load for thoughtful play.\nIt offers a cluttered array of many icons, effects and bits to give the illusion of depth, but the actual decisions offered are entirely rote. There is virtually no strategic interaction or decision making here.\nTo be frank, there isn't a way to play well in Terraforming Mars. Or, I should say, the \"skill ceiling\" is quite low. Making the best use of what you get is always simple and clear to navigate - success comes not from your choices, but just being more fortunate than the other players with drawn synergies.\nThe only significant way your decisions as a player could make a meaningful difference is if you consistently shoot yourself in the foot. Everything else is decided for you by draw and draft.\n\nIn short, the only strategy is to get lucky and not forget how to play.\n\nIt is clear that the fun factor in TM comes from the mechanical process of playing; reading cards, rotating cards, moving cubes around, performing simple math, etc. I admit, TM is very satisfying in mostion.\nBut while I love cube pushing as much as the next nerd, I want some amount of agency and ownership over what I'm doing.\n\nFor me, high luck games with limited player input are tedious and frustrating, especially when they come in the form of long multi-hour time sinks like this.\n\nIf you're looking for a more thoughtful engine building experience in half the time and with half the rules, pick up Furnace.\nIf you have your heart set on TM, go pick up the Ares Expedition instead.

After all, it's currently ranked #7 overall on this site, with over 100k votes. ...?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!\n\n...It's not good. I started writing a pretty long-winded list of complaints, but then I got tired and also figured no one is going to read this anyway, so I quit. The TL;DR is that the tile placement on the map lacks tension, ie is boring. The \"tableaux-building\" feels half-baked and incidental to the game, and card acquisition/management has no real decision-making, ie boring and boring. The 'take-that' element of some of the asteroids and whatnot seems to be an effort to add in some way to reign in a leader; it doesn't seem to really accomplish that well, and often feels arbitrary when no one's really ahead.\n\nThere's more to boot. I don't know how this game is in the top 100, let alone the top 10. What are people getting out of it that I'm not seeing?",

There’s a lot of card management which is fine, but a lot of luck with the draws and some starting corporations feel way stronger than others, so it can feel unbalanced from the start.\n\nAlso, there’s very little player interaction,you’re mostly just doing your own thing, which made it feel less exciting with a group. The art and components are barely decent. Combos can be satisfying when they work, but overall it didn’t really grab me. I might play it again, but it’s not one of my favorites and I fail to grasp why it is so high in the rankings.",

    "comment": "I came into the game expecting deep strategy and thoughtful planning, but after several plays, I found it quite underwhelming. It presents itself as a complex eurogame, but in reality, it’s a linear engine-builder with minimal interaction and a high reliance on luck.\n\nEach round you get four cards and mostly just play what you’re dealt — there's little room for long-term planning. Corporations often push you toward specific card types, which might never appear. Mechanisms like collecting animals or microbes feel like decorative extras with no real impact. Even the Mars map offers very little tension — if someone takes a spot you wanted, it rarely matters.\n\nOne redeeming element is the presence of a few aggressive/sabotage cards, which at least bring some interaction — though I wish they were more central to the game.\n\nInterestingly, a game like Isle of Cats, often labelled as a \"family game\" due to its theme, actually delivers a more thoughtful and tactical experience — with real planning, timing battles, and meaningful spatial decisions. Terraforming Mars, by contrast, gives the illusion of strategy without real control.",

It is way too long for what it does and the graphic design (of the cards) really does not encourage you to keep tabs on what your opponents are up to. I can't understand why you would choose this over Race for the Galaxy as Race does nearly the same thing, only better, in a fraction of the time.\n\nUPDATE: I suspect my above comments were a bit harsh and rushed. I need to give this one a second play and reevaluate.\n\nUPDATE 2: Played it again and some of my comments may have been a tad harsh. The graphic design on the cards is fine, but itis difficult to keep tabs on your opponents blue cards, which could be important. There are, IMO, too many cards in play by games end. And that’s my major negative: game length. Games can easily go beyond 4 hours. If it were over in 90 minutes or less, I wouldn’t mind playing it more. But as is, I will avoid this most of the time.

This is a game based on a random card draw that goes on far too long and has arbitrary player attacks to boot.\nWhy do there have to be 6 currencies? That's easily 3 too many. 2 hour duration? Halving that would be an improvement. The game is mechanically trivial, you draw cards and pay to put them into tableau, hoping to find little synergies that will get you ahead. The game really is all about eking out those little advantages, scoring at the end is pretty tight. If this is what the market wants, then this is what the market will get, but honestly, there's nothing here that Race for the Galaxy wasn't doing more elegantly almost a decade earlier.",

Especially since it's only good if it targets the leader, but a lot of times it ends up smacking someone who's already not doing well.\n\nIf I want to \"draw cards from a gigantic deck and see if you can build an engine!\" then I'll play 7 Wonders or Bruges. Those games are over faster and are more deliberate. If I want to do \"Take That\", I'll play Chaos in the Old World (it's shorter) (and better) (and has player interaction) (and isn't prone to massive swings in flipluck).\n\nSo, yeah. It's not quite to the level where I would actively avoid it and choose to play nothing, but it's pretty close.\n\n*Update* After revisiting it with a 2p game, it simply takes too long for what it is. All of the engines that are possible (yet unlikely due to the huge deck and wide variety of cards) means the game will take a long time and yet be fairly random. It's just not worth the time.",

Because it's been too long since I've played and I can't in good integrity give it lower without more acute memories of it's badness.

    "comment": "1) Terraform Mars as a mega-corporation.\n2) A card-based engine-builder with a decent dose of interaction via spatial board play, races to fulfill common objectives, and a player-controlled endgame timer.\n3) What I loved: The app is excellent as a game takes an hour, tops, the card-based engine building, especially with drafting, offers a nice rush of dopamine in the later stages. Mostly, I loved the fact that this is not an MPS affair - while the board play is relatively simple, it does offer interesting choices and tradeoffs, and allows you to capitalize on opportunities generated by your opponents. Finally, the end-of-game timer also offers a lot of options for interaction in non-obvious ways. For example, if oceans and oxygen are maxed out and you are interested in slowing down the pace of the game, you can fund the Thermalist award, even if you have no chance of winning it at that moment. This presents your opponents with a choice - conserve heat, thus slowing down the end of the game by not raising the temperature on Mars, or ignore the award, letting you catch up in heat and possibly take it. What your opponents are doing matters - if you see an opponent gearing up for an animal strategy, you can try maxing out temperature before oxygen, so that when oxygen is maxed out, they won't have time to capitalize on their animals. It is a good game.\n4) Could be improved: A slog to get through face-to-face, and I am not sure it deserves the time investment. If Ares Expedition significantly simplified the card-play and kept the board play, it would have been an improvement.\n5) First time I played this, I enjoyed it and was able to come up with a decent strategy, almost completely ignoring the board. I did not win. The game also took us 4 hours, so I didn't feel the quality of the interaction and the choices justified that. So I rated it a 6. Now I play it often on the app - the game takes an hour at most, even with drafting. For this duration, the game is excellent, combining dopamine-inducing engine-building with agonizing choices with tense board play. As a physical product, I would rate it a 7, as an app, a 9, or maybe even a 10! I'll split the difference and call it a strong 8.",

The choice to take one or two actions each turn is interesting.\n\nHowever, the following things annoy me a lot:\n- Players decide the end (all conditions for terraforming need to be met), results in very long games (4h+ with 4 players) or weird rushes to the end. I prefer fixed amount of rounds.\n- No bonus if the action is already maxxed out (o2 value, temperature track, oceans)\n- Randomness of cards if lots of expansions are mixed in. You can wait for ages for cards matching your strategy\n- Impossible to track the VP of other players (hidden across many cards) and thus unclear whom to target\n- Stealing resources and production can kill your strategy, as the leader is not clearly known (i.e. you cannot bash the leader).\n- Essentially multi-player solitaire with negative player interaction. I prefer engine builder with more player interaction, but less stealing. Shared VPs (like gardens) are interesting, the rest is just boring interaction.\n\nOverall I vastly prefer other engine builders to terraforming mars and will play at most with 2 players in the future.",

But I love sci-fi settings and can warm up with the idea of establishing an industrial infrastructure, reshaping the Martian environment.\n\nThere are some cool things going on on the red planet. A vast, literal sandbox is waiting to be cultivated. Picking individual achievements and milestones within a limited set makes up for great races. The implementation of the three victory condition parameters - oceans, oxygen and temperature - almost single-handedly generates a fascinating theme.\nDisillusioning to find out, that the game's core - again - is just generation and conversion of a multitude of ressources, while the somewhat interactive actions on the central map remain underwhelmingly unexciting. As promising as the story starts, the game guides players onto a thin line between a tense tug of war and an uneventful drag in lack of an overall arc.\nMy experience is purely based on the digital Steam version, which frankly is the only way I can imagine playing the game. Physically the ressource cubes fiddling and victory point counting absolutely would kill it for me.\n\nAs far as the much-cited comparison goes, I don't think Terraforming Mars is as good as Race for the Galaxy, neither I can understand its BGG rank. My initial impression of the game was meh. Something whispering got me back however. Several times in fact, I've tried out different strategies, which makes me think. Terraforming Mars will never be a fav for me, still it has something to it. Probably that's my ignorant way of saying we can be friends somehow. Rather distant friends.",

    "comment": "The new hotness, rapidly rising up the BGG list just three weeks after its initial US release in late September. Have played 8 times already, and predict that the newness will probably wear off after 6-9 months or so. Positives: interesting, unique theme, card-driven with a couple of unique elements but nothing you haven't seen before. On the negative side, the outcome seems highly luck dependent unless you use a drafting variant which will certainly add to playing time. To date, I have mostly avoided the longer Corporate game also due to concerns about playing time, as 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the base game seems about right, length in terms of number of rounds depends on the # of players, fewer players means more rounds to hit the three endgame criteria. Most games have lasted 12-N or 11-N rounds, N being the number of players. (I.e., a five-player game will generally take 6 or 7 rounds), so this makes planning for the endgame a bit easier.\n\nOverall, this is a solid game that will remain popular until the next new hotness comes along, probably in a month or two when the Essen titles hit the States. So, right now a solid 7 but frankly don't see it getting much higher.\n\nEDIT: My prediction, at least for me, has come true. I haven't played the game for over a month now and don't see any urge to rush to play it again. I think other new releases, in particular Great Western Trail, the new Tesla vs Edision and Manhattan Project: Energy Empire are much more interesting.\n\nUPDATE July 2023: Still very popular with others, but not for me. I just think games with multiple card options and a bunch of icons (I include Ark Nova and the more recent Earth in this category) are not my cup of tea.",

You could call this a medium-heavy euro but it takes less than 10 minutes to teach, and I feel comfortable introducing it to some more casual players. Regardless of individual performance, one feels a strong sense of accomplishment and ownership with the distinguished economy they have built.\n\nBut I find context very important, and the truth is Terraforming Mars did not invent any of its mechanics. In fact, tableau and engine builders are one of the most popular types of games produced today. Being innovative isn't terribly important to my enjoyment of a game, but the point is there is a lot of competition for this particular itch.\n\nWith that in mind, I'll get into my issues with the base game. First, it is way too long with too much downtime. Second, the luck of the draw is massive. Players are trying to find cards that synergize well but the game shows you far too few cards in a huge deck for this to work. Third, it is mostly multiplayer solitaire, but the interaction they do introduce through the take-that effects comes off as lazy and annoying. Many people mention the poor production, but this doesn't particularly bother me (bad art is more entertaining sometimes).\n\nHowever, fans of the game suggest some fixes. The drafting variant is supposed to fix the luck of the draw issue and introduce more player interaction. I have to admit that it helps with these issues, although I was surprised by how much I still felt screwed by card draw. Perhaps graduated decks would help the issue more. Unfortunately, drafting is a wash for me because it makes the length problem much worse. And I haven't even mentioned the corporate era variant that many fans swear by which also lengthens the game because you start with no production.\n\nThe other major fix is the Prelude expansion which aims to speed up the game. Players are given more bonuses to start with so it's generally less plodding. While the game feels better with it, I feel it only shaves off about 10 minutes so Prelude failed to fix the major length issues. The map expansion (Hellas & Elysium) is a solid expansion as the base game map (along with its awards and milestones) can be underwhelming and repetitive. I can't speak for the other expansions but they come off a bit convoluted to me.\n\nEven with these fixes, I find Terraforming Mars mediocre. There are some cool bits so I guess I understand its highly positive status, but it's thoroughly not for me. Race for the Galaxy remains my favorite tableau builder and feels like Terraforming Mars but with a fraction of the length, cost, and luck and more interesting player interaction.",

I do wish that scoring was a bit more clear during the game rather than it almost completely being a surprise at the end of the game. I don't know my strategy isn't working until the game is over. This is a tough one with one of my friends due to his AP and slow turns.\n\nUpdated: Have played this several more times now and have cooled even more. I think my group are big fans but this drags for me so much (my friend got the fully kitted KS and I'm ready to sell my copy). Not sure if it's how we're playing it but it takes forever. Even when I do my best to rush the terraforming the game is just so slow. Add to that it's fiddly with bad art and I've played enough TM for my taste. I'm sure it'll hit the table again and I wouldn't not play but I also won't be suggesting it.",

    "comment": "Two issues with this game: scaling and random card draws:\nI played at 2 players because of the way the game comes to a close it is just as long as it would be at higher player counts, possibly longer. As a consequence you wind up doing a lot more stuff as many of the cards have odd rule exceptions and lasting effects it becomes impossible to keep track of everything that you can benefit from in a given round. It becomes as fiddly as the little bronze cubes.\nThe other issue comes from getting the right cards, this ultimately is an engine building game and so most of the satisfaction in the game should come from building a finely tuned engine which is just starting to hum as the game ends. The problem is with this you could build an engine and never get any fuel. People complain about the random card draws in Imperial Settlers, I know that a bad hand at the start can really hamper you but ultimately there are always things to do with those cards because they truly are multi-use here your options are: don't buy the card, pay to trigger it's effect or buy it and give up later costing you 2 money. The cards not being multi-use isn't the problem here it's the fact that the randomness of the draw prevents you from planning for the future and building an engine in an engine building game, and in a game of this length I really should have more say over the route I take, it shouldn't just be 3 hours of trying to do the best with the cards I have now. All that said I hope that the drafting variant will mitigate this and when I play again I will definitely try it but: I fear it will add to the length of the game which will only add to the problems it already has. Perhaps one thing they could have considered is making you move up the tracks quicker in a 2 player game.",

    "comment": "I was very late to play this highly-praised classic, and I found it a bit underwhelming. This engine builder seems to have a lot of breadth (many different cards, tiles, resources...) but not much depth. There are simply not many important decisions to make apart from the choice of cards at the beginning of each round. From what I've seen, the expansions just lean even more into this, adding cards and new maps but no meaningful new mechanics. I think the main appeal of the game is the endorphin rush that comes with seeing your initially weak engine develop into a powerful combo machine. Unfortunately that also means that the rounds (and the downtime) get longer and longer as the game goes on.\n\nAs everyone knows, the production quality is subpar. I don't really mind the illustrations, you may even find them sort of charming in their own outdated way. However the thin and impractical player boards are really terrible and just an excuse to get players to spend extra.\n\nLastly, the theme of efficient corporations transforming Mars for the good of a unified humanity reads, at best, like a naive fantasy from another age, and at and worst, like some Elon Musk propaganda. Not my kind of sci-fi.",

And there are plenty of unique cards to draft. But man is it a slogfest. Luck of the draw plays too central of a role as well, you can set up the perfect strategy only to never get the chance to execute it cause you can't seem to draw a card with x or y symbol. You can also have someone with an excellent starting hand just steamroll to victory while everyone flops about helplessly. For what it's worth, it's a pretty fun game. But definitely not anywhere near my favorite.\n\nI'd be willing to give it some more chances but for now I'm tossing it in the same bucket as Ark Nova (derogatory).",

Simple rack up the most Victory Points by the time Mars is fully terraformed. That means raising oxygen, boosting the temperature, flooding the planet with oceans, and building the infrastructure of tomorrow. But points also come from launching wild projects, claiming Milestones, funding Awards, and planting your flag in the best spots on the map.\n\nThe moment all three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, oceans) are maxed out, the game ends after that Generation. Add up your Terraform Rating plus extra Victory Points to crown the winning corporation.

However, there are a lot of different card types and getting what you need in cards can feel somewhat lucky. There are some problems and they are mostly with the components and the art. The real problem with the graphics is that they are inconsistent. Some card art is fantastical, some are just simply stock photos and some are blurry and abstract. The components are cheap and flimsy but it is necessary almost to get the upgraded components from ETSY to have a more enjoyable time. They should have had double layered card board like Scythe for the trackers. Nothing can ruin a game like this one more than bumping your flimsy player board. Some parts of the rules are very fiddly and there's a lot to keep track of but it starts coming naturally once you played it awhile. The graphologist and iconology could have been a lot better.",

But (on contrary to most critics) I do like the artwork. That's a plus.\n\nAlso, it gets too random and disbalanced with the card / combos. With drafting it takes too long. Best choices are obvious.

That card probably won me the game, while I unceremoniously threw away cards that represented entire cities, or the ability to bring down meteors on top of my opponents. It’s silly! The theme disappears as you just focus on calculations and how to pump your numbers up, and it honestly results in some funny situations. You get to run your ridiculous engine probably for four turns too long, and the game lasts maybe an hour longer than it should, but it’s so satisfying that I wouldn’t mind playing again. I liked it much more than I expected, but that might have been due to low expectations. I just like Euro games! Most of them feel the same, though, and this is no exception, but I’m almost always happy to play. However, this was a reminder that most euros aren’t worth playing above the 1-2 player count. There’s so little interaction in this game, so why on earth would I want to play with more people?

The multiplayer solitaire gameplay where I don't really have to care much about what other people are doing with lots of downtime between turns at higher player counts really bugs me personally. I'm also not really fan of how helpless you feel when losing because of how snowbally this game is.\n\nThat said, the cardplay and engine building in this game is satisfying, and by the end everyone will feel like they made something cool. Great for more conflict averse gamers who love seeing those big resource numbers.\n\nedit: Over time, I find myself wanting to play this less and less. I'd much rather play Seti or Ark Nova for taking a lot of Terraforming Mars' best parts but having a prettier look and more variation in gameplay, at least to me.",

It's possible to go through several hours of playing this game and get to the end and say stuff like \"What's the animals for?\" or \"So what's the deal with this Phobos planet?\". I feel like this game could use a little bit of streamlining to make it a tiny bit less fiddly with how some of the cards work and with how it's just way to easy to forget to do something. Like remembering all the different rules about which tracks to advance in which scenarios would be hard without someone there who really knows the game well. We found ourselves handing cards to the veteran player often with questions or to get clarifications as a lot of them were not very apparent how they worked. We had to constantly remind each other to advance certain trackers. Some of this could be assisted with better player aids. They do have 4 player aid cards but their are only 2 sets of them. Why could they not have added additional sets and combined them onto one player aid card instead of four?\n\nThe artwork on the cards also seemed quite inconsistent where one picture might be a drawing while another might be a photo of a dog. Finally, my last gripe is that this game desperately needs tracker covers because trying to keep all your little cubes in the right places makes me nervous.....\n\nNow it may sound like I dislike the game having said all that, but to the contrary, I actually quite enjoyed it. This is actually not a bad game. For having so many flaws, I still this the mechanics are interesting enough that I would consider this a good game, although not for everyone and certainly not a gateway game.\n\nWhen you play with the corporations (which I highly recommend), it gives each person a different feel and a different strategy to go for. Overall, it's a fun game. I do, however, recommend you have at least one of the players at the table be a veteran rather than having everyone trying to learn it at the same time or it could make the game go long.",

But the acclaim and fanbase it has garnered puzzles me.\n\nI'm guessing the theme has a lot to do with it. The setting is rather evocative, after all, and it was the first thing that drew my attention. But, then again, the game is rather themeless in practice. Despite having a map and many, many cards, each with images and flavour text, Terraforming Mars is little more than procedural. And sure, I get that it's difficult to make someone feel like they're really terraforming a planet using pieces of cardboard. But I've never even paid attention to the theme of TM as I'm playing, focusing instead on the plenitudinous symbols. In short, TM's theme is as barren as Mars itself.\n\nWhat of the cards? It's often said they're the highlight ot TM. The game, after all, has tonnes of cards. And yet, the card play is just okay, and more than a bit inelegant; I really think the game could do with a paring down of some of the more boring and underpowered cards. I'm sure TM fanatics will disagree with this assessment, and they're probably right to point out that more plays will breed familiarity with the cards and thus more paths to victory. But to be honest, for me the game just isn't interesting enough to warrant such a time commitment. It's an occasional game for me, and I can't see that changing.\n\nTerraforming Mars is a great example of the principle that often, in game development, removing the excess can lead to a much better game. TM, at least in my view, is drowning in the consequences of no one having made the tough decisions as to what should be streamlined.\n\nWhen playing TM, never play without the Prelude expansion; it speeds up the otherwise lethargic early game. I'd probably recommend card-drafting too, which curbs some of the game's luck, except that it makes the game much longer. And, if I haven't already made this clear, Terraforming Mars is already way, way too long.\n\nWhat of other expansions? Venus adds a whole new track that lengthens the game with no real pay off. Colonies adds interesting power-ups that are worth including (easily the second-best expansion). Turmoil, which adds a whole new and exceptionally tedious phase, is a crime against humanity and should be taken outside and burnt.\n\nAfter quite a few plays, during which I really wanted to like it, I ended up selling TM. It seems I'm in the minority. But in sum, this game is overlong, lacking theme, and quite the grind.",

One play only but can see the strategy and variety and know why people like it so much. It's also pretty thematic for a euro but it's sadly not a theme i like since I don't care for/tend to dislike space and sci-fi themes. Components are okay but the tiny cubes on player boards can move really easily which can be fiddly.\n\nOverall, I can see why others like it and it's depth, and downtime is alleviated and analysis paralysis is alleviated through the 1/2 actions at a time but it is still a bit long game. I think I def prefer shorter games, 90 minutes or less honestly. The point salad aspect means scores are closer and you also can't tell who's truly winning too which is nice for keeping you into the game.\n\n58 points in my 3 hour ish game. Took 20 min to learn ish from two teachers, a bit messy being taught.\n\nTime issue - 3 hours without drafting. With draft it'd add a lot of time. 5p game played btw. Overall okay but not a game for me. I don't think I felt that much tension or excitement. It was just an okay game for me. Not a bad engine builder by any means but not an exciting game or anything for me. Same decision points throughout so I felt it could've ended a round or few shorter and been the same satisfaction. 58 points third place in my first game of 5p in the middle and respectable. Not much attacking but some attacking cards. Not a fan of that. We played without Venus cards or expansions I think. Prelude only the teacher said.\n\nTwo other thoughts: I tend not to light the mechanic Pay to fund X project of most near-ocean tiles but you may not get anything out of it. I dislike how it can help others so much more and how I could get nothing both out of it if other players get the right cards or combo. Its also hard to see across tge board at tiny icons other players have, and can be hard to plan something long term with out knowing what cards I may get. Seems to lean more tactical?\n\nPlayed again 4p and won 80-60s-60s-Forget last number but still a lot of take that and long time for beginners, 3.5+ hours with learning. Eh its okay. Not crazy for theme still either.\n\nPlays: 2+ but can see the depth of all the cards so could be convinced to try more as I think it's the kind of game to reward replays.",

Without knowledge of cards more experienced players have huge advantage becuase lack of balance of cards. Still like this game but it has few issues. First cards are not balanced and to solve it people play draft variant of this game. Which solve this problem but make game much longer (also doesnt work for solo game because there is no draft there  Theme is great. Art are very nice a little bit inconsistient but still nice. Some people say those are bad but I have seen really bad arts like in Legendary Encounters alien than I am not gone complain. Some expansions are great and some are horrible. At the end its monopoly on steroids with great theme. For me there could be more negative interaction but thats my personal preference. But this balance issue is the reason why I dont play it too ofen bacause some cards are much stronger than others and u look for this cards and some are totally useless. Most of the time thats why many people complain they know how game is gone finish after 3-4 turns. But with draft which make this game much longer it solve that problem. Normaly its 1-2h game with draft its slow down a lot 2-4h game...Still like it but probably gone keep it because of the theme. If u dont like this kind of theme dont waste your money. Solo game is also nice fast (no draft) but quite random fest. Look for good cards for first 1-3 turns. Probably in future I am gone play this game with my home rules remove op cards and really bad one from game and it should make game faster and more balanced. I am gone try this maybe its gone work.\nIts good family game. If u want a brain burner its not that kind of game.\nProbably becuase of this family friendly atmosphere I should give it score 7.",

The core rules are pretty simple, but the game is full of meaty decisions, especially when you include the corporate era cards (once you try them out there's no going back, I will never play with just the basic set of cards again). This has to be one of the most thematic euros out there.\n\nThe only real drawback I can think of is the length of the game, I wish it was a little shorter as it can overstay its welcome after 2,5 hours of intensive play (you should be able to cut the playing time by 30 minutes once you master the game though).\n\n/update, January 2018: Downgraded from 9 to 8. It's just too long for what it is, Race for the Galaxy offers even deeper engine building experience in 30 minutes so it's hard for me to get Terraforming Mars to the table these days - there's always something else to play when I have 2+ hours. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a very good game and I enjoy playing it, but when I play something that long I need a game that offers a bit more player interaction to keep me involved throughout the entire thing.\n\n//update, January 2019: Adding Prelude and keeping the player count low (2-3 players) is key for having a good time with this game (playing with 4 or 5 just introduces unbearable downtime).\n\n/update, October 2024: I've revisited this game 5 years later and my thoughts on it have changed completely - it's a 6/10 for me these days.

Overall, I find it a stronger game than Scythe - the three global trackers (heat, o2 and water) are integral to play and will be moved up over time. You are in a race to terraform Mars by creating an efficient economy by way of lite deck/empire building.\n\nI think the strongest aspect of this game is it is not too heavy for a casual gamer, despite it leveraging so many board game elements: action spaces, drafting, deck building, economy/engine building, tile placement, elements, multiple resources, etc etc etc. Despite so much going on, it is not so weighty, which is due to clever game design.\n\nIts weakest point is it's just not very exciting. There's no ah-ha moments, no gotchas, no satisfaction in setting the cards down. It is a small and monotonous climb towards the end. There's no excitement with combat like there is in Dune Imperium or Scythe, no pride in maxing out your sheep in Agricola, no satisfaction of getting Longest Road or thrill of getting to move the Robber on a 7 in Catan.\n\nIn Terraforming Mars, you just move some economy sliders, place some cards, and put some tiles down before counting up the numbers. It is very exacting, and for a game that's so precise it doesn't feel like you have a lot of control. You draw 4 cards per round and pay $3/card. There's 7 sliders, 3 types of cards, 4 types of tiles, 3 global trackers, etc etc. There is a plethora of variables and with only seeing 4 cards/round it can feel very limiting - especially if you were to pull an even more limiting corporation.\n\nFor this reason, I would presume this game feels strongest as a relaxed solo game that gives a wide berth for plotting and planning (it does not surprise me that there is a strong solo player presence online).",

For example, Jupiter or Science cards are very few and don't give many bonuses or cost too much to be of any use at all\nThe draft drags the game down a lot and doesn't solve the problem of randomization quite well\nSimilar situation with the cards that give winning points. With a couple of exceptions, only rewards and cities/forests really affect the game.\n\nNevertheless, the game is made qualitatively, the rules are simple, the game is quite active, easy to learn in almost any company.

    "comment": "This game is greatly overrated. It's an ok tableau / engine builder with a very anti-climactic ending. Every time I play this I like it less and less.\n\nWhile I don't have a problem with 2-3+ hour games (in fact most of my favorite games range in the 90 to 180 playtime), they need to feel satisfying / exciting in order to justify that amount of investment.\n\nThere are many resource management tableau builders that are more satisfying and often shorter than Terraforming Mars. Some examples include: Everdell, Res Arcana, 51st State Master Set, Empires of the North, Race for the Galaxy (though this is less explicit resource management), Underwater Cities (very similar, but this one has a more proper ending, in my opinion).\n\n\nThe game starts very slowly (a little faster with the Prelude expansion, you'll save 2-3 generations in a 2p game on average with Prelude). You're initially just trying to boost up your production to be able to play more cards / actions each generation (round).\n\n\nThe game starts slowly, though it can play quickly if every player thinks about their turn while others are playing. I have a couple 2 player plays at around 60-75 minutes, which I think is reasonable for what this game offers as an experience. However, some people can make this game last forever. I had a 5 hour long 5 player game (never played 5 players again after that), 4 player games rarely last under 2.5-3 hours). Especially near the end of the game, when they have a bunch of action cards to think about too. This greatly increases downtime especially at 4+ players. This game is a 3 players or less game for me, I do not believe this game is worth an investment of over 2 hours.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game is that towards the end of the game, when your engine is finally up-and-running and producing good amounts of resources, you barely get to do anything interesting. There are no interesting decisions left to be made anymore. Most terraforming parameters will be capped out and there is likely only 1-2 generations (rounds) left. These two factors together make literally around 75% of the cards you have in your hand or draw useless. Worst part is that the final 1-2 generations will take up almost half the game most of the time, because people have so many action cards they need to go through to get that 1/3 of a point. Then you'll have some people stalling, selling 1 card at a time (or using 1 action then passing) to see what other players are doing and where they're placing greeneries. This makes for a very anti-climactic end of the game where all players just spam as many cities trying to benefit off others' greeneries, since most cards are now useless and they just spend it all on cities standard projects. There's a couple cards that give some VP with a decent VP / megacredit ratio that are worth playing, but otherwise no interesting decisions, just slog through the actions. An abrupt / uninteresting ending is fine for short games. For example, I don't mind getting taken out early in King of Tokyo, as the game lasts under 20 minutes. When I play a game for 2 hours though, it feels bad if it ends on a weak note.\n\nThis problem is less prominent at 2 and 3 players, as each player will get to build more of their engine and contribute more to the terraforming (less players for the same amount of terraforming to do), but the last 1-2 rounds still always feel bad to slog through.\n\nThere are a LOT of cards, so that definitely contributes greatly to the replay ability of this game. However, there are many cards that are basically useless and I've never seen played (and I've played over 20-30 games by now), and ones that are played in every single game.\n\nThe corporations feel different enough and relatively balanced from my experience, so that's a big plus. A couple feel a little more powerful, but I've seen them lose a fair bit, so I don't mind it too much, it doesn't feel overwhelming if there is a difference in power.\n\nI much prefer the drafting variant for this game, but it does add some play time, so many people don't want to play it. Without draft, there is a significant reliance on the luck of the draw, as card usefulness and synergy varies greatly.\n\nI have mixed opinions on the objectives and awards. I like the concept of racing others to complete these, slowing down your engine slightly to secure them first. My main issue is that I feel like it's such a wasted opportunity for more interesting varying goals tokens each game. If they were 4-5 random tokens selected each game out of say 12-15, that would spice up the gameplay a lot in my opinion People would go for different strategies to compete for the objectives, instead of always rushing greeneries, cities or building tags. I'm not interested enough to get the Hellas & Elysium expansion boards (the objectives are still static on these boards too anyway, they're just slightly different).\n\nThe art for the cards is all over the place and so random. Some of them look like pictures, others like abstract paintings and others like cartoony drawings. There is no coherence. The board and markers are also aggressively \"meh\" as well (aesthetically speaking).\n\nLastly, this game's components are atrocious in quality, especially for the price. Paper thin player boards, poor card art, chipped cubes.\n\nMost expansions for this game are also quite mediocre.",

There's always something I'd rather play than Terraforming Mars, but I probably wouldn't say no to a game either if that's what others wanted to play, and I'll absolutely crack this open as a gateway game if I think someone will really dig it.\n\n+ Simple, strong cardplay that guides players toward helpful goals\n+ Plenty of room for self-expression in pursuing victories or strategies (use the draft rule or the game is excessively random)\n+ Newer players can mostly ignore the central board and focus on their hands and tableau\n\n- The central board, despite holding many of the victory point opportunities, feels very much like a means to an end and is often an afterthought because the things that happen there aren't very interesting, which means they end up not being very evocative even though that's where the terraforming of Mars actually happens\n- Even with card drafting, can be very random what cards you see and what strategies you can pursue (though this also adds to replay value)\n- Doesn't do too much to help newer players with AP",

    "comment": "This game is pretty darn heavy and complex. While turn structure is very straightforward, resource management, action choices, and point calculations are very complicated. It takes a while to get a feel for everything that you can do and why each thing you can do matters. For instance, the first game I played, I forgot to activate milestones and didn't understand the value of placing tiles until the mid/endgame. There also doesn't feel like there is much of a choice in terms of what kind of engine you want to build, because there are a lot of options but the best card is usually a very straightforward choice. That being said, the game is still pretty fun if you like something thematically rich and you enjoy building large engines. Seeing all the different project cards and being excited to build all of them is pretty cool, and it is impressive they managed to design all of these unique projects. It may be a bit long for me to want to play this regularly, and because of all of the different resources and rules to manage, I would much rather play this on the computer rather than as a physical board game. In addition, it ends up feeling less like its theme and more of a min-max calculation due to its competitive form, which is a turn-off for me.",

Helps to play with Skylar versus with Matt. Still lots of AP, this kind of game is not good for my brain. I'm almost certainly the biggest bottleneck as far as game length goes. That probably improves if I were to crank out 10 games on BGA (doubtful that I will do that). The problem is that I have no heuristics built up in this game, there are no automatic decisions, and every decision requires thought.

    "comment": "Used to love it, as it was one of my first strategy games.\nLearnt to hate it, when we bought & added too many expansions at once + had more fun with other games that didn't took several hours to play.\nStarted to have some fun with it when it was already decided we'd sell the game.\nPlayed a solo game on BGA once and had great fun with it, and it only confirmed my suspicions.\n\nIt's a good game as long as all the players can control themselves and not get carried away with dopamine rush of drawing new cards. So, I'd gladly play it again, but with everyone agreeing on playing it relatively fast... hence it's a 7/10.\n\nI appreciate TfM for the way it speaks to novice players. Maybe it's just the theme, maybe... something else. But I've seen or met a lot of people who were casual players at best, and so many of them were just amazed by this game. We didn't know that many games the first time we played it, but already perceived ourselves as gamers, so learning the rules wasn't that hard, but it may be for beginners. And yet, they're so eager to just have it done, they actually want to learn how to play. And all this effort pays off.\n\nThere's quite a lot of things you need to take care of in the game, and it just... works. There's a lot of types of resources, but they don't feel like several flavours of the same thing, as they're connected to different game mechanics. There's a huge deck of unique cards that often make great combos together, and they all feature a bunch of icons you may want to collect, but also some of them have special conditions, and you're quite likely to draw cards that can't yet be played... but sometimes, the card can't be played ALREADY. There's a shared map and a few types of tiles you can place on it, each with its own cost and requirements and impact on the game/further placement of tiles/end game scoring. There's a race towards a few achievements, but it's also good to specialise in something and spend some money to fund a prize you may later win, as it's worth some VPs at the end of the game... but someone may do better than you and grab the prize for themselves. Finally, there's the whole thing with terraforming the planet by increasing three stats: oxygen level (by planting trees), global temperature (by turning energy into heat and spending it to move the marker) and presence of oceans (represented by ocean tiles in a shared pile). And usually, you may make such progress some other way, by using proper cards, including single-use event cards.\n\nIt's a lot, especially for a beginner, but once you played a game or two of TfM, it's just... really easy, taking turns just comes naturally, and the most thinky part here is deciding on which new cards to keep everytime a round starts, and coming up with a right sequence in which you want to play them... if only you're rich enough to afford it. That's it. It's enough to keep the players captivated and make them want to play the game more and more.\n\nAnd here's the tricky part. Constant influx of new cards is exciting, a bit too exciting. It brings so many new possibilities! But, as you're quite low on cash, especially in the first few rounds, you won't be able to play all you want and just save those cards for later... and when you draw new cards, you may want to postpone playing those expensive cards, as you've just got some nice, cheap ones...\nIt's just how our brains work. And it's also an easy way to may ALL of your games of TfM, not just the first few ones, take AGES to finally end. Getting a lot of cards is cool, it helps you learn what's inside the main deck, but you need to start focusing on some strategies and picking just the cards that will help you put this strategy into practice and some that will keep your economy at decent level.\n\nIt took me quite some time to learn that and I'd like to spread this message to novice players so that they won't ruin TfM for themselves as we did. I'm not saying that sticking to your strategy and focusing on bringing the game closer to the end whenever you can, and as soon as you can is the only way to enjoy TfM - but please, think twice before you add additional cards from Corporate Era variant or buy unnecessary expansions (such as \"Venux Next', 'Colonies', 'Turmoil').\n\n+ relatively heavy game that attracts new players, even non-gamer ones\n+ cheap & widely available at bookstores, supermarkets etc.\n+ is quite easy once you start playing it\n+ nice economy\n+ all cards are unique\n+ various types of special requirements on cards\n+ a few kinds of player interaction\n+ adds board & tile placement to a tableau-building card game\n+ can be a gateway game that makes people interested in strategy games\n+ asymemtric player powers with corporation cards\n+ corporate era expansion cards allwo you to play a more 'baroque' variant of the game\n\n- the cubes easily lose the paint, some aren't fully covered in paint even when you open the box for the first time lol\n- constant dopamine rush of new cards and unlimited size of a player's tableau can make the game SOO LOOOONG\n- it takes some time before your engine starts working properly... 'prelude' expansion is highly recommended\n- unplayable without double-layered player boards \n- those two points above mean you need to buy additional products and then the game's not so cheap anymore\n- incoherent art style\n- a lot of cards to shuffle...",

I'm not sure exactly why that is.\n\nMain problem: it's pretty easy to just entirely ignore what other players are doing for large portions of the game, even at a decently skilled level of play. In the early game, what they do doesn't really affect you; in the endgame, there's too much to keep track of to really know where you stand in relation to other players. It's one of the more interactive games of this particular breed of Euros, but it's still full of phases where you're just disengaged from other players' turns.\n\nAlso an occasional lack of interesting decision space. Can feel too often like a game that's full of objectively best moves. I don't think this is always the case, however. The terraforming path as the endgame trigger is also a great bit of design--creating this central mechanism whereby players are constantly influencing the pace of the game and moving towards a conclusion and often questioning whether they should speed up or slow down is great. The engine building is fun, but I think that collective timer is the real heart of the game. (Obviously it's not totally original, but I think this is a good implementation of the concept)\n\nIt's still a very fun game overall, but it all feels very fuzzy and full of rounded edges, vs. some of my preferred management games that have a much greater sense of precision and balance.\n\nAlso doesn't help the balance that the game fundamentally changes a ton with each additional player: goes from massively rewarding slow play and exponential growth with two players (perhaps too much) to punishing all but the most efficient of engines at five. I get why they made most of the decisions they made, but the game has some pretty much unplayable strategies (microbes, most egregiously) along with some cards that are way too good to pass if they're available--it's hard to feel a sense of agency when a lot of the time, you're basically compelled to take one card and focus on that for the whole game.",

Some are very specific to conditions of the game, and keeping a card on a whim, for a combo that might not work out, doesn't work.\n- Often you are keeping cards from other opponents, and discarding them. That's the only player interaction in the game\n- The engine-building would benefit from tighter synergies\n- Unforgiving for new players. Learning curve is very steep. Very difficult to catch up\n- Difficult to tell what information is relevant to gameplay\n- Horrible art\n\nPositives:\n- Interesting Theme\n- Intuitive Iconography",

The sheer variety of cards and the way they interact with the 3 conditions to terraform Mars make for an interesting puzzle. I like how players jointly influence pace of the game and learning how to tweak your strategy based on the group meta from game to game is important.\n\nDespite its solid mechanisms, paper thin player boards with small cubes that get knock out of place with the slightest push is frustrating to use. Low effort stock art is hilariously bad and it feels like you are playing a prototype rather than a well thought out production.",

    "comment": "I think what I enjoyed most about this game is the mechanics of it. It felt like a well oiled machine. The resource management and general economy of the game felt good and I liked the pacing. So overall, I'd be willing to play it again, but I'm not sure I'll ever go out of my way to do so. My critiques may be based on ignorance, since I only played two games and we were all beginners. First, there was a lack of player interaction, which I know is typical of these kinds of games. But that made the games feel a little dull and quiet. Second, the player interaction that the game does provide seems thematically odd. Like one of the only ways to affect another player's economy is through expensive asteroid cards which destroy part of another player's plant economy. I guess at the end of the day this not only feels like a cheap and unsatisfying player interaction, but also just strange. What is happening in the game? Am I directing an asteroid to strike a colony or something? On the thematic note, I'm not really sure that playing with the different companies really adds much thematically. Like when I played as the cinema company, I didn't really feel like I was getting much from the theme or game in general. Finally, and I would be curious to see if this observation holds up to more playthroughs, but each game ended up following the same pattern, and it is a pattern that seems a bit baked into the game. The temperature maxed out first, oceans maxed out second, and the game ended with oxygen getting to 14%. This isn't a problem per se, but even after 2 games it felt a little stale and predictable. The only thing keeping things fresh was the huge stack of cards.",

    "comment": "What I like: Individual player actions are short enough to allow table to continuously take actions on the board, varied resources allow incredible diversification of strategy, balance of ignoring or playing the board is fantastic and makes either a strong option.\n\nWhat I don't like: Oh dear, the components. The default boards for income have no indents (ala Evolution), meaning you're often swatting the board and forcing pieces off their location. The card art is **terrible** and I mean truly terrible, including what is clearly one piece of Mass Effect Illusive Man fan art, and while the card art is terrible, the flavor text is seldom if ever better. The base game is extremely slow to start, so Prelude is almost mandatory in my view.\n\nWhat I'd say to someone interested: In your opening hand, keep only cards that you will play in the first two turns. Do not be afraid to quickly audible your strategy, even away from your corporation's core strengths, if you're not picking up the cards to do what you want. The board has a lot of points which are your income as well, and there is something to be said for focusing on early heat and O2 gains.",

Its around $200 (as of 6/15/20) to get the core game and it's several expansions. Preludes is regarded as a \"mandatory\" expansion to fix the very slow game start of the core experience.\n\nI would not turn down an opportunity to play this game if my friend suggested it.\n\nI like watching Shut Up and Sit Down video reviews. I disagree with their general assessment of the end game of Terraforming Mars going on auto pilot. I think this can happen based on what your strategy was that particular game but it doesn't happen every game. I think this is a consequence of the nature of engine building games. People experience 5-10 games and form generalized opinions (makes sense when your trying to form a coherent opinion to present on a YouTube channel). The reality is that games like this really take hundreds of plays to get a real feel for their potential. I feel like this game is worth playing more often than not.\n\nBut, I've only played 4 times so what do I know?\n\nUpdate 12/28/20: I've got about 25 hours into the digital game and I love it. It avoids all the hassle of setting up and tearing down. I also own the Prelude expansion. I held off on the digital version because I read a lot of reports that the game was horribly buggy. That seems to have been fixed and I haven't had a single issue yet.",

    "comment": "Terraforming Mars is an incredibly well designed engine building game. The variety of expansions allows players to increase the complexity and modify the interaction to suit their preferences, but Prelude is the only one I love since it shortens the game and gives players more direction to begin.\n\nEven the base game was very clever about giving different starting options, making the teach easier and modifying the game length. The simplest version gives all players starting production, a free opening hand of cards, and no player powers. From there, you can add corporations to vary the starting production, purchase opening cards to add some tough decisions early, and draft cards to reduce luck and increase the chance to find synergy among your cards.\n\nThe graphic design and production quality are reasonable and don't take away from the gameplay. These could have been improved, but I think the publisher made the right choice by minimizing physical weight and price instead of prioritizing components and art.\n\nMy rating would be higher if it was an objective rating of the game, but unfortunately my desire to actually play this is highly dependant on the group since it can run very long when people make slow decisions and some people have studied the cards to the point where their opinions of what is \"a correct action\" detract from the overall enjoyment.\n\nBoardGameArena.com has a well designed implementation with many expansions available.",

Rated as it is based purely on theme and based on how I know I can get others to play a game if I bring it up.\n\nAfter many, many more plays since this initial review I don't know that I'd call this mindless but definitely lighter. The solo version is very entertaining. I don't think I'd ever willingly play multiplayer again without the draft variant, though. Still very easy to get to the table and this deserving of this rating even if I would rather usually grab other tableau builders like, say, It's A Wonderful World.",

Wersja Big Box z elementami 3D zdecydowanie obowiązkowa bo wówczas gra zyskuje na wyglądzie bo karty są......po prostu brzydkie.

In my opinion, the only way to play is with the card-drafting variant (which unfortunately adds lengths) because it cuts down on the randomness and allows for greater strategic play.\n\nWe've also tried the cooperative variant for this. It's not bad, but it's not as good cooperatively as it is competitively, and we have other cooperative games we'd rather play more.\n\n(Also own Terraforming Mars: Prelude, Terraforming Mars: Hellas and Elysium, Terraforming Mars: Venus Next, Terraforming Mars: Colonies, and Terraforming Mars: Turmoil.)",

    "comment": "2025-10-26, 9/10 @ 34 plays:\n\nThe ultimate new school euro game. The progenitor of the \"here's a euro game with 100+ unique cards\". Others have tried (Wingspan, Earth, SETI, etc.) but this one is still the best. You have all the \"play X to get more resources which let you do Y\" gameplay of the standard euros, plus the contracts/goals in form of the milestones/awards, plus the board for area control, plus the asymmetrical corporations, plus the fighting over the bonuses on the oxygen/temperature track, etc. The game has a great arc. You go from barely able to do anything, but with the potential to do anything, to having more money than you can spend per round but being focused down a certain path.\n\nPeople don't like that you sometimes just don't draw into cards that match your strategy. I think that happens a lot less than people make out, and is punishment for not planning around that scenario. I also don't understand the hate for the \"destroy opponents plants\" cards. These are necessary to stop players just hoarding greenery until they can spam a bunch in one turn. It's a necessity for the game to work.\n\nI've only ever played with two or three players. I like both player counts, would like to try more, but I expect it maybe go on for too long.\n\nWhy isn't it a ten out of ten? This game is a 10/10 with a few expansions, but the base game alone is not perfect. The game has a slow start. The Prelude expansion solves this, and more, as it grants initial bonuses and adds even more asymmetry. Once you've played a few times, the awards/milestones on the base map can start to feel a bit samey. The variable awards/milestones expansion makes each game significantly different, the new maps are an icing on the cake. You only need the first map expansion. Colonies makes energy more useful, adds some easier way to get resources, and adds some fighting over when to fly to colonies. Venus Next is not good and can be skipped. The Venus board is barely used in our games, and floaters are very situational. I also have Prelude 2, which is probably not necessary, as I think the prelude cards added there are unbalanced. I do not care to add Turmoil, as I think the game is now \"complete\" for us and has enough variability to last for years to come.",

    "comment": "Overall - 9/10\n(Solo - 2/10)\nThe more we play Terraforming Mars, the more we love it. It's a really fun engine-builder with a simple concept - each player runs a company and can score points in 4 ways. One of these ways - Mars’ global parameters - is limited and triggers the end of the game once all of the points are gone. How you choose to score points is up to you and there's a massive deck of cards to figure it out.\n\nThere are a few things that really put this one over the top compared to other, similar games:\n\n+ A menu of standard projects are available for players “stuck” with cards they can’t/don't want to play. There is always something you can do to move forward, regardless of luck (though luck really helps).\n\n+ The parameters being limited controls the length of the game at any player count. At 2, the game will take 12-16 rounds as terraforming is less frequent. At 5, there are 6-8 rounds with players scrambling to grab the points before they’re gone. This also changes the companies and strategies that work best.\n\n+ Each company and project card feels very balanced overall. I can’t think of any throwaway cards in the deck nor any that are overpowered. Still, quite a few are extremely memorable (Deimos Down, Search for Life) so there is still that excitement of finding ones you love.\n\n+ Milestones/Awards and the shared map provide the right amount of interaction for this type of game. Payers can’t destroy each others’ engines, but they can capitalize on mistakes, grabbing points from unprotected greenery, blocking clusters of cities, nabbing early awards to force the others to pay big money to get one, and so on.\n\nI really appreciate the feeling that I am able to come up with my own path through the game and seeing whether it ultimately works out or not. Things will change, of course, because the cards you'll get are unknown, but by the end of the game you have created your own, unique company, and get to enjoy its success or failure. This is the piece that's missing in Ark Nova and why I like Terraforming Mars so much better.\n\n- The most obvious gripe is the incredibly poor quality of the tokens, the artwork on the cards, and the cost of the game. I think the game itself overshadows these and no one I've played with has cared beyond a joke or two, but for those that like a premium feel when they're paying a premium price, this will definitely drop the game a peg or two (and it has impacted my score).\n\nSOLO NOTE: I've played Terraforming Mars solo one time. I didn't care for it as instead of playing a somewhat normal game against an automated opponent, you instead simply try to complete the terraforming in a set number of rounds. This makes so many cards and strategies useless, since only the terraforming part matters; it effectively turns the game into a luck-fest where you hope to get cards that help build heat and plant production.\n\nThere is a new Automa expansion that makes the solo mode more like playing against a human, which sounds better, but I have yet to try it.\n\nTheme - 1.5/2\nRules - 1.75/2\nTurn Simplicity 1.75/2\nFun Factor - 2/2\nChallenge and Replayability - 2/2\n\n(The theme is cool and there are a lot of interesting facts to be found in the rules, but the artwork and components are so cheap-looking that it detracts quite a bit. That said, the concept of running a company tasked with terraforming a planet feels unique and consistent throughout the game, and the map comes alive as the game progresses.\n\nFor a game this heavy, the rules are fairly easy to teach and turns aren't very complicated. That said, there are some small rules that can be tough to remember and there is quite a bit to consider on your turn.\n\nThe game is a blast to play and there is enough asymmetry, randomness, and valid strategies to make every game unique.)",

    "comment": "Kurzrezension:\nIn \"Terraforming Mars\" versuchen die Spieler gemeinsam den Mars bewohnbar zu machen. Es ist aber alles andere als ein kooperatives Unterfangen! Nur derjenige, der die Parameter des roten Planeten am besten beeinflusst, gewinnt am Ende die Partie.\n\nSpielablauf:\n\"Terraforming Mars\" ist ein Kartenspiel mit Spielplan, der im Grunde nur eine Statusanzeige darstellt.\nIn jeder Runde erhalten die Spieler eine Reihe von Karten, die - nach einem Draft mit den Mitspielern - auf die Kartenhand eingekauft werden können.\nWer am Zug ist, führt ein bis zwei Aktionen durch. Standardaktionen sind auf dem Spielbrett angegeben. Sie kosten eine Menge Geld, verändern die Oberfläche des Mars und erhöhen damit das eigene Einkommen, indem Grünflächen, Städte und dergleichen errichtet werden. Mit einer weiteren Standardaktion können Meilensteine und Auszeichnungen finanziert werden, die bei Spielende für denjenigen, der sie erreicht, wichtige Siegpunkte wert ist.\nHauptsächlich werden Aktionen zum Ausspielen eigener Karten genutzt. Es gibt sie in drei verschiedenen Versionen:\n- Grüne Karten stellen einmalige Bonnies zur Verfügung, bleiben aber offen ausgespielt, da sich andere Karten auf ihre Symbole beziehen können.\n- Blaue Karten bieten dauerhafte Effekte oder zusätzliche Aktionsmöglichkeiten pro Runde.\n- Rote Karten werden nach dem Ausspielen auf den eigenen Ablagestapel abgeworfen, sind meist sehr teuer, beinhalten dafür eine große Ausbeute.\nIm Spiel werden sechs verschiedene Ressourcen verwaltet, von denen jede mit einem Einkommensmarker nachgehalten wird, die am Rundenende automatisch Ressourcen generieren. Geld, Stahl und Titan werden überwiegend für das Ausspielen von Karten genutzt, kann aber auch an anderer Stelle Verwendung finden. Mit acht Pflanzen können Parks auf dem Mars erschaffen, um damit den CO₂-Gehalt zu erhöhen. Energie ist zum Betreiben von Karteneffekten und für den Städtebau wichtig. Nicht genutzter Strom wird am Ende der Runde in Wärme umgewandelt und diese dient schlussendlich dazu, den Mars zu erwärmen!\nImmer wenn einer der drei globalen Parameter (Ozeanfläche, Temperatur oder CO₂-Gehalt) erhöht wird, steigt der Terraformwert des auslösenden Spielers. Dieser ist für das Geldeinkommen jeder Runde wichtig und stellt gleichzeitig den Siegpunktmarker dar.\nAm Ende jeder Runde erhalten die Spieler Einkommen für alle sechs Ressourcentypen. Außerdem werden alle Marker von den blauen Aktionskarten genommen, bevor eine neue Runde beginnt.\nDas Spiel endet nach der Runde, in der alle drei globalen Parameter ihr Maximum erreicht haben.\nWer dann die meisten Punkte aus Terraformwert, Meilensteine und Auszeichnungen, sowie den Punkten auf manchen Karten hat, gewinnt die Partie.\n\nErweiterung:\nDie erste erschienene Erweiterung \"Hellas & Elysium\" ist ein neuer Spielplan mit neuen Meilensteinen und Herausforderungen. Durch die beiden neuen Oberflächen des Mars ändert sich auch das Terraformen des roten Planeten, was zu einer etwas anderen Herangehensweise führt. Vor allem sind es aber die Meilensteine und Herausforderungen, die diese Erweiterung lohnenswert macht.\n\nIn \"Nächster Halt Venus\", der zweiten Erweiterung des Erfolgshits, müssen sich die Spieler zusätzlich um die Belange eines weiteren Himmelskörpers kümmern. Die Venus soll so umgewandelt werden, dass ein Leben auf schwebenden Stationen der Atmosphäre möglich ist. Dazu liegen der Erweiterung neue Projektkarten und ein neuer Spielplan - der die Venus und deren globalen Parameter zeigt - bei.\nFür meinen Geschmack fügt diese Erweiterung etwas zu viel Spielzeit hinzu, ohne den Spielern einen Mehrwert zu bieten. Ich spiele mit ihr dennoch von Zeit zu Zeit ganz gerne.\n\nDie \"Preludium\" bzw. \"Preludium 2\"-Erweiterungen bestehen hauptsächlich aus den namensgebenden \"Prelude\"-Karten, von denen jeder Spieler mit zwei aus vier Karten ins Spiel startet. Diese Karten erhöhen diverse Einkommen und sorgen für einen Grundstock an Symbolen und überspringen damit quasi die erste Spielrunde des Grundspiels.\nVon all den Erweiterungen kann ich \"Prelude\" uneingeschränkt empfehlen. Der langsame Aufbau, den die ersten paar Spielrunden des Grundspiels bestimmt hat, hat mit dieser Erweiterung ein Ende. Sie wirft die Spieler direkt ins Geschehen und beschleunigt das Spiel ungemein, ohne den Spielspaß zu trüben.\nFür mich ein Muss für jeden TFM-Fan.\n\nDie vierte Erweiterung \"Kolonien\" fügt mit weiteren Projektkarten eine neue Mechanik ins Spiel ein, mit der es möglich ist, Kolonien zu gründen. Dazu stehen verschiedene Plättchen bereit, auf dem die Raumschiffe der Spieler platziert werden können, um diverse Sondereigenschaften zur Verfügung zu stellen.\nAuch diese Erweiterung mag ich sehr. Sie vergrößert zwar etwas die Menge an Regeln, bietet aber auch eine weitere thematische Möglichkeit an Punkte zu kommen.\nIch mag die Kolonien sehr, oftmals können sie aber aufgrund von Neulingen am Tisch nicht mitspielen, was sehr schade ist.\n\nEine enorme Menge an Regeln bringt die \"Aufruhr\" Erweiterung mit. Sie kümmert sich um die politischen Belange der 'Erde' und des 'Mars'. Die Spieler können 'Politiker' in den Rat setzen, was Aktionen und Geld kostet. Dafür dürfen sie mitbestimmen, welche Regeln die Kolonialisierung des roten Planeten beeinflussen sollen.\n\"Aufruhr\" ist eine geniale Erweiterung, da sie dem Grundspiel eine weitere Möglichkeit hinzufügt, sich im Spiel zu entwickeln. Außerdem erhöht sie die direkte Interaktion der Spieler auf ein noch höheres Niveau. Allerdings lasse ich diese Erweiterung oftmals weg, da es Neulinge am Tisch einfach überfordert. Schade eigentlich, denn sie ist nach \"Präludium\" die beste von allen.\n\nMeinung:\n\"Terraforming Mars\" ist ein Spiel, das öfter gespielt werden sollte, um die große Anzahl Karten und deren Effekte kennenzulernen und einschätzen zu können. Spätestens ab der zweiten Partie sollten auch die Standard-Konzerne weggepackt und mit denen des erweiterten Grundspiels gespielt werden. Zusätzlich empfehle ich dringend zur Draftvariante, bei der die Kartenauswahl wesentlich gerechter ausfällt, als beim zufälligen Ziehen vom Deck. Somit kann ich nur absolute Spielanfänger das abgespeckte Spiel empfehlen, um erst einmal ins Spiel hineinfinden zu können.\nMir gefällt \"Terraforming Mars\" mit jeder gespielten Partie immer mehr. Ein kleiner Wermutstropfen sind die Doppel-Layer Spielertableaus, welche in anderen Spielen selbstverständlich enthalten sind, für dieses Spiel aber teuer nachgekauft werden müssen. Im Grundspiel sind nur dünne Ablagetableaus enthalten, auf denen die Marker verrutschen. Bei dem Preis des Spiels eigentlich eine Frechheit!\nAuch ein Insert kam erst mit einer \"Big Box\" hinzu. Diese enthält dafür beeindruckende 3D-modellierte Landschaftsplättchen und sorgt damit für eine tolle Tischpräsenz!\nAnfangs war ich von \"Terraforming Mars\" nicht überzeugt. Es brauchte drei Partien, bis es mich begeistern konnte und heute bin ich froh, dass ich es damals nicht direkt verkauft hatte. In der Zwischenzeit spiele ich es auch oft digital, da die haptische Version bedauerlicherweise immer noch zu selten auf den Tisch kommt, obwohl die Spielzeit für ein Spiel dieses Kalibers durchaus angenehm kurz ist.\nIch empfinde das Spiel auch als überaus thematisch. Viele andere stören sich an den unterschiedlichen Illustrationsstil der Karten. Für mich gehört dies aber dazu, denn es arbeiten schließlich eine ganze Menge verschiedener Persönlichkeiten daran, den Mars bewohnbar zu machen und diese Menschen stellen ihre Projekte eben auf unterschiedliche Art und Weise dar.\nVon den Erweiterungen habe ich alle schon gespielt und kann in erster Linie \"Präludium\", sowie \"Präludium 2\" wärmstens empfehlen. Sie beschleunigen das nur langsam in Gang kommende Spiel um ein bis zwei Runden. Wer es etwas komplexer und mehr Interaktion wünscht, der sollte sich auf jeden Fall die \"Aufruhr\"-Erweiterung näher anschauen. Und wer sich einfach nur etwas Abwechslung wünscht, dem sind die verschiedenen Kartenerweiterungen \"Hellas und Elysium\" und Co. zu empfehlen.\n\"Terraforming Mars\" hatte es Anfangs schwer bei mir zu punkten. Mittlerweile gehört es aber zu meinen liebsten Spielen im Regal.",

It's scales nicely with the number of players - it is an enjoyable option for 2 players. Of course with the increased amount of players downtime impacts the game (especially if played with Draft variant during Research phase). Interaction without the Draft variant is very limited, that the game almost remains solo game with solitaire.\nAll addition cards should be played as it enrich the game - especially \"Preludium\" as it speeds up a game.",

The first half of the 5 player game with beginner corporations was overwhelming and I wasn’t impressed. But, as I got a small engine going, it started to click. By the end, I really liked it. Then, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So, a few days later, I bought the game. We played a 2 player game yesterday with the other corporations and the draft variant and fell in love! This game is great. I can’t wait to explore more.\nThe only 2 negatives are the luck of the cards and the length of the game. It takes too long. And if you get cards that don’t work together at all, it can seriously put you behind.",

Prelude(revs up the beginning of the game; could perhaps create slight imbalance issues, but definitely worth playing with, to spice up the pregame festivities)\n3. Colonies(nicely adds options in obtaining certain resources - makes energy much more valuable... perhaps too much so)\n4.

Se disfruta desde la primera partida ya que es muy fluido de jugar, llevando a los jugadores de la mano en todas las rondas, no es un juego dado a la parálisis por análisis, deja muy claro los objetivos y las acciones a realizar en cada momento. La mejor expresión es: su mecánica funciona como un reloj.\n\nLa sensación de evolución y que cuanto más avanzan las rondas, más rápida es tu maquinaria de producción hace que a pesar de su duración no se haga para nada pesado, ya que cada vez se vuelve más frenético. En definitiva, produce constantemente sensación de satisfacción y crecimiento.\n\nLa re-jugabilidad está más que asegurada debido a la cantidad de cartas y las diferentes interacciones de las mismas con las estrategias y tácticas que se presentan en cada ronda de juego.\n\nY sí, los componentes son mejorables pero son funcionales. Yo llevaba años retrasando meterlo en mi colección debido a las malas críticas sobre este punto, hasta que un amigo jugón me insistió en sus maravillas y me decidí a hacerme con él. Pena no haberlo traído antes a mi ludoteca.\n\nEditado: Después de unos cuantos años, partidas y todas las expansiones, tengo que decir, que como más lo disfruto es a 4 jugadores. Es donde el mapa coge más importancia y estrategia y decide muchos de los puntos. Lo he jugados mucho a 2 jugadores y, en este caso, el mapa casi queda como algo secundario. Aunque sigue siendo toda una experiencia.\nPunto malo: A 2 jugadores se nota muy multijugador solitario. Cosa que a 4 se mitiga un poco.",

    "comment": "Terraforming Mars – Few games balance cooperation and competition as elegantly as this one. You and your fellow megacorporations are tasked with turning the red planet blue and green — raising oxygen, warming the atmosphere, and planting forests where once there was only dust. Everyone contributes to making Mars habitable… but only one of you will get the credit in the end. The entire game is driven by a massive deck of unique project cards — from viral microbes to asteroid impacts — creating endless paths to corporate glory. It’s an engine-building masterpiece where every decision feels like a small step for man and a giant leap for your profit margin. Tense, clever, and deeply replayable, Terraforming Mars is the kind of modern classic that makes you forget hours have passed — much like waiting for your heat production to finally pay off.",

It's very rewarding when your engine grows and when you see how everything fits together. Great game to play solo, especially during the pandemic (doesn't take very long solo). Theme is great (bought a novel 'red mars' that inspired this game but haven't read it yet) but the game has poorly made components with dated design. I might invest in 3D tiles in the future.",

The engine building is good, thought - in the base game - there is a problem of \"lucky draws\" (drawing 4 good cards, can be negated a little by using a draft mechanic). Strategy exists and is crucial for winning, as there is much to learn.\n\nI'd recommend this game for anyone that wants to sit and think for a longer period of time, while strategizing.

The addition of the Prelude expansion is a must, as it enhances the game by giving players a more engaging and varied start, setting the tone for the entire game.\n\nWith its high replayability, rich strategy, and thematic depth, Terraforming Mars delivers an unparalleled experience that will keep you coming back for more.

Es muy entretenido, funciona fenomenal a dos jugadores, es adictivo y gratificante porque se siente muy bien al jugarlo. Además, es un cooperativo extraño, porque todos los jugadores buscan hacer habitable el planeta Marte y, sin embargo, todos ellos controlan empresas que compiten unas contra otras. Por eso, muchas veces, lo jugamos sin las cartas rojas de agresión, porque pensamos que empresas científicas no se harían la zancadilla las unas a las otras. No obstante, a veces las metemos en la partida si queremos disfrutar de un tono más agresivo. ¡Ah!

It takes some time to explain the game rules, but once explained everything works just fine\n- Huge replayability\n- Huge tactic variaty (you can win the game in lots of ways)\n- Cards design - all cards are unique and all of them are with explanation text. I.e. all corporations are with background, all projects are also explained in game lore. Thats huge amount of work!\n- I love player interaction.\n\nBut unfortunately there are cons.\nMajor one:\n- Horrible component quality. The game board is worn out after 2 games. Very bad player mats, money cobes which became damaged after one playthrough, game cards are also cheaply made. Even the game box if thin and poorly assembled.\nI wouldn't thought that I'd ever consider a component quality as a major flaw, but here it is.\n\nAnd minor flaws:\n- A lot of useless cards at the end of the game. Splitting cards into 3 eras would be a great idea\n- The game is somewhat long. If you have a person, who never played the game or at least one person with AP (analysis paralysis), the game session could last more than 3 hours. It takes for 2 experienced players to finish the game in 1.5 hours.\n\nUPD. Played it almost 10 times. Liked it even more  I think it's in my top 5 favorite tabletop games ever and it's even gets 4th place there  .",
