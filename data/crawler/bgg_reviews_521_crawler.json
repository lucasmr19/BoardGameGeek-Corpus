But more than just that, easily one of my favorite games.\n\nI own a custom board, decorated with my Game Bistro logo, and signed on the back by all the regulars of my old game night. This is a treasured possession.\n\nKeep",

Despite the simplicity of components and rules, the game has a depth to it that is related to the ability of the player to flick their discs effectively.\n\nI had never played this game before working at Fantasy Flight Games. James Torr had a board that he brought to work and for quite a while it was the lunch time game to play.\n\nIn February 2010, I pre-ordered a board from Mayday Games but I am still awaiting its arrival. I look forward to playing this game actively again.\n\nComments entered on 04 Sep 2010:\n\nI received the board from Mayday Games yesterday. Very nice and will begin increasing the number of plays significantly.",

People who don't enjoy board games will likely enjoy it, and many board gamers don't enjoy it either, so its inclusion on BGG seems misplaced. If I had to either get rid of all my board games or get rid of my crokinole board, I would keep the board and dump the games.",
