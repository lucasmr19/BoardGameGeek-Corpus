    "comment": "I dislike games that use this \"everything but the kitchen sink\" design philosophy. It reminds me of PeeWee Herman's breakfast machine that allows him to crack an egg in a convoluted but flashy 20 step process.\n\nIn this game you're trying to fill up a board with rectangular pieces that you get from placing workers on one of forty different action spaces. These spaces might give you rectangles for free, or you might have to play a card or roll a dice to get rectangles, or you could upgrade a rectangle you already have into a slightly better rectangle.\n\nThe huge board with it's sheer number of actions feels grandiose at first sight, but everything is so interchangeable that to me it felt like it lacked depth. All of those choices drown out any sense of tension. In other worker placement games, there's a push and pull between needing a space, but wanting to wait because you might get more out of it if nobody else takes it. Here, if someone takes the space you want, it's a mild inconvenience because you can still easily go to several other similar spaces. The fact that it's all for a simplistic tetrimino-like game, make the whole experience feel underwhelming for me.\n\nOne more example of how extraneous mechanics there are: you have to feed your people. But it's nearly impossible to not feed your people because the game is so generous with food during the income phase. There are ideas here that I enjoy. For example the job cards, and how you use more workers for better spaces. I just don't feel like it's worth the effort of setting up and explaining this game.",

This is a very complex game with a lot going on, but my second play helped me to see 'the systems behind the systems' and understand the point of the game a little better.\n\nAt its heart, this is still an optimization game, and it still feels like there's a lot of needless obfuscation in the mechanics, but it's at least inoffensive.

I did ignore several of the submechanisms in the game on my play, but at least the core game play loop isn't too overbearing. It also helps that the feeding in this game is pretty mild unlike Agricola, so if you miss out on some optimizations in the other submechanisms you aren't drowning in point debt. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game. Another thing I didn't think I would like is the covering up your aspect, as I don't like too strong of a polynomio spatial aspect. But that also isn't too bad; it's only about the level of Patchwork or even less; people who really like polynomios might be disappointed in the tile laying in this game. I like that there are occupation cards like in Agricola, and also the excitement of the hunting/whaling/raiding actions, even if the risk in those actions are very on rails.\n\nI wonder if the game being a lot less tight than Agricola will eventually make it less tense. Or maybe it will just remove the stress in that game. Only time will tell, but I think its potential is about the same level.\n\nEDIT: After more plays, each action outside the get new things to cover up feels too closely cover up 2-3 spaces, rather than doing different things.",

    "comment": "Honestly, tile placement and puzzle are not my thing. First time of playing this game, I mean I only watched half of a tutorial video and barely been taught before playing. Still I scored 72 VP and only 2 points from the winner in a three players game. He obviously played many times and was doing so well on the tiles and income. Like he received 11 coins start from fifth round and 17 for final round. Meanwhile, I only received 1 coin each round for the entire game. Must be something wrong with the calculation right? Here comes how a sophisticated euro strategy gamer performed! I figured out the livestock tiles would be a very good long term investment and paid off 22 points finally. Another magic trick is flip the boat tiles, I mean I got to know they can be flipped and worth almost triple points kind of in the middle of the game, so next time maybe start from take livestock tiles and boat tiles and that's it. Let's see how this strategy will work?",

Wer an der Reihe ist, setzt einen seiner Wikinger auf eines der vielen Aktionsfelder. Dort erhält der Spieler verschiedene Plättchen, die allesammt Ressourcen oder Nahrung in verschiedenen Formen darstellen. Diese Plättchen können dann - von unten links beginnend - auf das eigene Tableau gelegt werden, wo sie Minuspunkte abdecken. Um die eigene Wikingermannschaft zu sättigen, ist eine ausgewogene Ernährung wichtig, die auf dem rechten Feld des Tableaus gepuzzelt werden muss, dabei ist zu beachten, dass gleiche Farbplättchen nicht aneinander gerenzen dürfen, um Fleisch und Gemüse in der Waage zu halten...\nMünzen sind Joker, die als 1x1 großes Plättchen in jede Ritze passt und ebenfalls zur Ernährung der Mannschaft diesen darf.\nJe voller der eigene Spielplan wird, desto mehr Einkommen generiert dieser im Spielverlauf und desto weniger Minuspunkte am Spielende\nNach einer festen Anzahl Runden endet das Spiel und alle Spieler können ihren Flickenteppich aus Fellen, Fleisch, dazwischen liegenden Münzen, Met und dergleichen betrachten. Wer jetzt die meisten Punkte gesammelt hat, gewinnt.\n\nMeinung:\n\"Ein Fest für Odin\" ist im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes ein Schlachtfest. Das Spiel hat mir in Ansätzen tatsächlich Spaß gemacht und wenn die Puzzlerrei nicht wäre, wäre es vermutlich sogar ein tolles Spiel, welches ich gerne wieder spielen möchte!\nIch weiß es wirklich nicht, kann mir aber absolut nicht vorstellen, dass die Wikinger damals ihre Beute mit veredeltem Essen und Strickjäckchen auf dem Boden verstreut und mit Silbermünzen und Granit veredelt haben.\nEigenartig finde ich auch, dass sechs Arbeiter von einem ganzen Stück \"Wal\" nicht satt werden, aber von einem Humpen Met und drei Halme Stroh sehr wohl? Das liegt daran, dass die Spielmechanik längliche Nahrung vor breiten bevorzugt.\nIch finde das Thema völlig aufgesetzt, aber okay, es ist ein Euro-Game!\nMan nehme, was man kriegen kann, konzentriert sich dabei auf die größten Plättchen und wertet dieses dann so weit auf, dass es irgendwie auf die eigene Insel passt, streut noch ein paar Münzen dazwischen, sodass frühzeitig ein hohes Einkommen generiert wird, mit dem man in künftigen Runden wieder Lücken stopfen kann und bekommt seinen Plan schnell voll.\nWem das Spaß macht - mir nicht wirklich - dem sei \"Ein Fest für Odin\" empfohlen. Ich bin froh, es mal gespielt zu haben, brauche es aber kein weiteres Mal.",

It features deep strategy and many choices, with rules that are not that hard to learn.\n\nEven though a worker placement is naturally interactive, the set of choices is so big that I feel like you always have something nice to do. Also, the different spaces on the board don't change and evolve during the game, so it feels a bit static. From game to game, the setup is almost the same each time which also don't really motivate you in changing your strategy once you found a good one. For these reasons, the worker placement part is less interesting than Agricola in my opinion, even though it's still great.\n\nOn the other hand, the resources part and the tiles placement is more interesting, because you have to think all the time about the tiles that you need, and how evolved you need them, You can also buy new islands that you will also be able to fill with tiles, and all of that together really makes it very fun and complex.\n\nOverall, I think this game is very similar to Agricola since these are two complex worker placement games, and in my opinion they both shine in different aspects.",

This time featuring polyominos, dice, and a TON of options!\n\nA Feast For Odin is fun: there's a veritable cornucopia of different ways to approach the game, with the goal of collecting enough polyomino tiles to fill out your player boards as best you can. It's a low interaction, fairly low randomness efficiency puzzle. For me, this would lead to a game with low replayability, were it not for the various cards, which really make this game. Not enough to hype it up over more interactive experiences, but enough to make each game different, and have interesting decisions. I still worry that at experienced tables this \"sandbox\" of options dwindles rapidly in favour of the established, most efficient paths, but luckily I am not an experienced player.\n\nIt's one of the better heads down experiences I've had, but it's not as exciting as I'd hoped. As a solo puzzle it IS fun: there's a ton to explore here. But I'll always favour more interactive games over another MPS Euro that has more pieces than the last.",

If you're not raiding, you're not winning. I have yet to see any combo of occupations that makes a no-raid strategy feasible. I guess then the game becomes about how you're optimizing outside of raiding? Which, okay, sure, that's fun, but it's still coming in below Agricola for me, where your occupations and bonuses are shaping your whole game, rather than just some subplot. It's good. Won't be rushing out to buy it.\nUpdate: raiding began to feel pretty stale again,.still a good game but I'm rapidly cooking on it for how excited I am to see it on the table.",

    "comment": "Another great addition to the Uwe Rosenberg worker placement series. This combines Agricola and Patchwork, making the WP less competitive but adding the spatial puzzle for additional solitaire strategy.\n\nThis game is excellent, but a bit un polished without the expansion, the expansion is absolutely needed to smooth out the card luck and ensure the card draw is interesting and engaging, without being a luck fest. Even with the fix of the expansion, the cards are still a little lucky, but it's nowhere near as game breaking.\n\nFor the most part the WP feels more like action points, although there are some highly desirable spaces that you will compete for, normally you stay out of each others way. Still plenty of interaction, but more the style of interaction where your opponents will cause you to pivot and adjust, rather than just blocking or shutting you out.\n\nThe meat of the game is in the spatial puzzle, its really well done. You need to balance, unlocking bonuses and income with the long term goal of filling up your board. It might be better at times to just cover over bonuses, and you have to be careful where you place greens on your boards or you can lock yourself up a bit. I also enjoy how food can be used to fill up boards, but only on certain things.\n\nMy favourite decision in the game is what houses and islands to take, although as I played more I realised that the game strongly revolves a rush to get islands, reminiscent of the rush for the 3rd worker in Agricola, which is kinda disappointing and reduced the feel of every game being different.\n\nThe only other issue I have with this game, is it lacks any excitement or drama to lift it into my favourites, nothing you do every feels really special, but its a consistently relaxing and satisfying game, which is not a bad thing sometimes.",

    "comment": "i think this is probably my #2 favorite game? i always have at least one game of it going on bga, it's always given as an option for \"what do we want to play tonight\" with my wife, and it has decent odds of being a game we play when we have more people. i am literally always down play this game.\nit's just so perfectly puzzley, not just the literal puzzle of placing goods on your boards but the puzzle of how everything works together. how do your actions segue together? how do your bonuses from your islands help you further your game plan? what's the appropriate timing to do that thing you're trying to do? so many nested questions that leave my head spinning in the best way possible.\nplayer interaction largely boils down to \"do the thing x player wanted to do\" but is anything more than that needed? having that be a constant consideration makes this feel like more than the multiplayer solitaire it is often derided as imho.\nmy only complaint is that the sheer number of actions available leads to analysis paralysis for me, even when i have a pretty firm game plan in place. but if my only complaint is \"there's so many options!\" then i don't think i have much to really be complaining about.",
